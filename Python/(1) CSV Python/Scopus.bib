	abstract = {Understanding the logic behind farmers' choice of adaptive water management practice is important to appreciate the opportunities and challenges they face and to scale targeted solutions effectively. This paper aims to understand the main drivers of change that induce adaptation in water management. The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework that juxtaposed the within and across micro-, meso-, and macro-level drivers was applied to a case study of the Nile Delta to identify key drivers of change and farmers' adaptive responses. The framework helped in contextualizing key gender, temporal, and spatial dimensions of the drivers, and to identify their individual and interactive effects on farmers' adaptation decisions. We find that farmers' gender-differential water management choices are influenced not only by the individual changes in the three spheres of influence but also their interactions. The study highlights the benefits of using MLP to identify challenges that should often be tackled simultaneously to improve agricultural water delivery and use. We demonstrated that adaptation choices in water management are more sustainable when farmers' decisions are supported by enabling environments, including local regulations, norms, national institutional frameworks, and policies. They are also informed by and responsive to global trends such as climate change and markets. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Farmers are front-line workers managing climatic change. As in many parts of the world, climate change in northern California is threatening natural resource-dependent communities by exacerbating droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires. This article draws on ethnographic methods, including 108 interviews with crop and livestock farmers and key informants, to query climate change experience, belief, and response in rural northeastern California. I find that farmers recognize and describe climate changes that match the meteorologic evidence of anthropogenic climate change, but attribute these changes to weather cycles and harsh geographies. However, irrespective of their belief in anthropogenic climate change, farmers implement climate adaptations—many of these practices with mitigation co-benefits, bolstering growing evidence that climate change belief and action are not tightly coupled. To accelerate farmer adaptation, this work suggests that policy and programming focus on actions and outcomes, rather than reshaping belief. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Adaptive capacity is critical for understanding the climate resilience of social-ecological systems. A gendered lens is of particular importance as women are simultaneously one of the most vulnerable social groups to climate change and carry a significant adaptation burden. Individuals’ adaptive capacity is partially determined by learning and cognition, specifically one’s ability to process, assess and react to a changing climate. Formal education experience is thought to increase the learning and cognitive aspects of adaptive capacity. This study uses a novel method, Participatory Adaptation Scenario and Mapping Activity (PASMA) to explore the influence formal education may have on the decision-making processes of pastoral women as they adapt to drought in Samburu, Kenya. Our results indicate participants with formal education may be more risk-averse following drought, but initially assess and react to signs of drought similarly to peers without formal education experience. We argue that increased risk perception might be explained by formal education’s influence on the learning component of adaptive capacity. We also contend that formal education may fail to influence the agency of pastoral women as a result of systemic issues, and therefore limiting the potential of formal education to improve adaptive capacity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We argue that the Commission needs to fund more projects that actively include local communities in the development and implementation of NbS. Specifically, the Commission needs to fund projects that include two oft-forgotten stakeholder groups: women and indigenous peoples. The literature demonstrates that success of NbS is dependent on the inclusion of a variety of stakeholders and that indigenous peoples and women and girls are critically important stakeholders. As the inclusion of these stakeholders is vital to the success of NbS, funding projects that specifically include these stakeholders will help the EU to achieve two important policy goals: the goal to provide evidence for NbS and the goal to advance the development, uptake and upscale of NbS.

	abstract = {The climate and environmental changes in the Global South have devastating effects on vulnerable populations, which have been perpetuated by socio-economic and political as well as gender inequalities and non-existent interventions to adapt and mitigate its adverse effects. Underpinned by the Protection Motivation Theory and Social-Cognitive Preparation model, this systematic literature review article depicts how vulnerable populations are impacted by climate change in the Global South. Using the empirical data from credible databases including the Web of Science and Scopus, 23 articles published since 2018 were searched, retrieved, coded, and classified with three themes emerging from the synthesised literature. The analysis of the literature confirms that climate change indeed impacts vulnerable populations adversely; the adaptability mechanisms are not applied by governments which are contrary to the international frameworks; and lastly, that such groups are discriminated against, undermined, and overlooked in societal programmes and interventions to mitigate the impacts of climate-induced disasters. Climate change impacts have severely destroyed the livelihoods of vulnerable populations and are exacerbated by socio-economic and political inequalities, with the adaptation and mitigation mechanisms deemed ineffective. Gaps in current research studies include the paucity of empirical data shedding light on the interventions provided for sexual gender-based violence victims and punitive actions issued against the perpetrators during and in the aftermath of the climate-induced disasters. There is also scant empirical data testing the adaptation and mitigation mechanisms’ effectiveness. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Because of variations in socio-environmental vulnerability, men, women, children, ethnic groups, and the elderly are affected disproportionately during climate disasters. Indigenous people are among the poorest in the world. Still, with a global representation of only 5%, indigenous people protect 80% of the biodiversity on the planet. Women are especially active in environmental care and ecosystem restoration. However, the dominant mindset in the North American political scenario has prioritized military security over environmental conflicts. Their reference object was the state. The values at risk are sovereignty and territorial integrity, reducing interest in people and nature. Gender security focuses on women, indigenous and vulnerable groups, analysing gender relations, equity, and empowerment to overcome the patriarchal worldview and institutions represented by transnational corporations, churches, and authoritarian governments. Latin America, especially Central America and Mexico (Mesoamerica), are highly affected by climate change. Indigenous women are also the poorest in the whole region. They have a limited capacity for adaptation and little governmental support. They often live in abrupt mountain regions or have migrated into unsafe slums of megacities. Indigenous Aymaras in the Andes have developed resilience and new ways to overcome pandemics, disasters, and poverty through their indigenous cosmovision of ‘living well.' It entails equilibrium between the requirements of nature and humans, which includes happiness as a guiding principle of life and equal behaviour among men and women. It embraces personal and family spheres and the environment, work, and diversion. Indigenous Zapatistas in Chiapas live in peace with and in equity. Their participative governance has eliminated the exploitation of women by men. Zapatistas have negotiated conflicts through consensus about sometimes-contradictory issues, where leaders obey the people within their shell model (caracoles). Their judicial system has evolved thanks to prevention, reintegration, self-reliance, and care about the most vulnerable, including nature and ecosystem services. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

Thus, the book chapter was conducted to assess the livelihood and ecological context of the climate change crisis for the women fisherfolk communities and their coping practices for their future uplifting in terms of the sustainable small-scale fishery. To achieve the goal of the study, the authors conducted a systematic literature review using a 6-step, systematic literature review protocol. Different journals, research papers, and books were reviewed for assessing the climate change impacts and coping practices of the women fisherfolk communities in the UNESCO heritage Sundarbans. A large rural population is dependent on climate-sensitive sectors of fishing activity and capture fishery in Sundarbans. As climate change directs ecosystem transformation, over the last two decades this region’s small-scale fishery is confronting challenges of extreme natural events, anthropological, and socio-political conflicts.

	abstract = {Climate change is projected to have a serious impact on all sectors of the world. The agriculture sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors with implications for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Africa in terms of poverty and food security. Several researches have been carried out on perception and adaptation with a little investigation to unpack the gender differences and how this influence adaptation strategies. This research investigates gender difference and gender-specific adaptation strategies to climate change and variability. A household survey was conducted from August to December 2014 using a pre-tested questionnaire where 150 males and 150 female farmers were randomly sampled from 14 communities within the Bolgatanga Municipality and Bongo district. Results show the existence of gender differences in the adaptation strategies. Both gender groups perceived climatic change and variability but only 49% male and 40% female headed household (HH) have adopted strategies to cope with increasing temperatures while 56% male and 49% female have adapted to decreasing precipitation. On the other hand, 62% male and 60% female HH have adapted to increasing drought spells. The main differences between male and female adaptation strategies are that males prefer to migrate and seek employment in other parts of the country whereas females prefer to engage in off-farm jobs such as trading, basketry and shea-butter processing. The age of farmers, access to extension services, credit, perceived loss of soil fertility, among other factors influenced farmers adaptation strategies. Policy decisions to promote adaptation to climate change and variability should take these factors into consideration. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The answer to this often-asked question, as expected, is not simple yet also not complicated - just a complex layering of scales and dimensions from engineering, environmental and social sciences, science communication and intergenerational recognition that there is not a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach - just as with technical infrastructures. With these perspectives in mind, this paper shares best practice on mobilising the co-creation of sustainable water-resilient communities in the south-west of England, UK. Consideration of evidence and engagement across multiple scales and dimensions is positioned through exploration and evaluation of projects undertaken through the Westcountry Rivers Trust’s Water Resilient Communities programme in two counties (Devon and Somerset). The projects cover town-based sustainable drainage systems (Sudss) co-created with residents, school-based Sudss co-created with children and teachers and a Water Resilience Summit and associated hub co-created with communities and businesses. Over 400 people were directly engaged in exploring, planning and co-creating different aspects, which met the intended objectives. Learning points were uncovered and reflected on to take forward into future projects to enable further mobilisation of sustainable water-resilient communities. © Emerald Publishing Limited: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We examine the effects of spouses' climate risk perceptions (CRPs), defined by their beliefs about unfavourable climatic events and associated damages, on climate change adaptation (CCA) and the observed gender gap in adaptation. Our analysis uses the intra-household data collected by independent interviews with 1,274 female and male spouses in Kenya, Uganda and Senegal. By addressing the CRP endogeneity issue using the exogenous weather shocks during data collection months as instruments, we find that a higher CRP of both female and male spouses increases their probability of adopting CCA strategies. We also find that a higher CRP of female spouses reduces the adaptation gap by increasing their relative adoption of soil and water conservation practices. Our results highlight the importance of understanding gender-differentiated behavioural and economic factors to design effective climate policy interventions.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This challenge is severely hitting the poorest and the most vulnerable resulting in changing patterns of interactions between societal and ecological entities. This chapter is premised on the socio-ecological theoretical framework. The research seeks to determine the unequal impact of climate change disasters on men and women in Lower Gweru community and explore the nexus between climate change, gender-conflicts, risks, and insecurities. It also assesses existing response mechanisms to foster resilience as well as capacity building to enable especially women to cope with challenges posed by climate change, risks, and insecurities. The research is a qualitative exploratory study of four villages of Lower Gweru. The sample consists of four village heads, two councilors, twenty household heads, two police officers, and two Community Health Workers, giving a total of 30 participants. The results revealed that climate change has unequal impact on male and females and cause gender-conflicts, risks, and insecurities. In addition, there are no viable response mechanisms or frameworks to foster resilience; therefore, the research recommends the design of a joint, coordinated and viable model for resilience that merges both gender analysis and climate change disaster resilience frameworks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Findings from 41 studies selected following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, mostly from Africa and Asia, suggest that climate change perceptions and adaptation are highly contextual and considerably varied by gender and different intersections. Existing gender role, farmers’ age, education, knowledge, marital status, intra-household power structure, religion, social status and ethnicity were intersecting with gender and climate change perception and adaptation. Apart from gender and intersectionality, access to resources, social network and local institutions are found to be important correlates of adaptation strategies by farmers. While agriculture being feminized, mere technological changes are not conclusive to climate change adaptation rather socio-cultural, structural and political changes in inevitable. Female farmers were tend to be more concerned and fatalistic about climate change which reminds us the urgency of culturally appropriate climate change communication to obtain informed decision regarding climate change. Future climate change research could be more gender transformative by exploring the existing inequalities lying in different intersections of gender rather than highlighting binary gender differences only. © 2023 The Author(s).

The various impacts of climate change pose significant risks to Pacific Island communities and people's livelihoods. A community consists of different groups of people and requires contributions from all members to build community resilience to the impacts of climate change. The Indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) women have skills, knowledge, and unique local and traditional experience that can increase the resilience of the community, however, their voice is not often heard in a patriarchal community. An understanding of gender roles in a community is essential for adaptation to climate change. Fijian communities exhibit elaborate social support system and traditional practices that demonstrate high level of dynamism and institutional support in the community's response to risks. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observations, the study investigated the enabling and inhibiting factors that affect the ability of iTaukei women to contribute to building community resilience. The findings from the study identified that the village women contribute significantly to three key areas of community resilience, particularly social resilience, economic resilience and ecological resilience. The findings also indicated that women face barriers that prevent them from contributing to decision-making on issues related to climate change resilience in the community. The study recommends interventions that are culturally accepted and that also support the role of women in decision-making, while promoting their participation in various climate change forums in the community. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

To minimise negative impacts on households, a priority is to understand and if possible build adaptive capacity to enable adjustment to both extant, and anticipated stressors. Adaptive capacity may not be equally distributed across households due to social differences and inequalities, including gender. In this study we sought to understand whether the factors underlying adaptive capacity differ between men- and women-headed households across three marine protected areas (MPAs) in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Adaptive capacity was significantly higher in men-headed households compared to women-headed households between different MPAs as a whole, however significant differences were not found for men and women-headed households within the MPAs. The factors underlying adaptive capacity were investigated through boosted regression trees, a relatively novel approach within the field, and found to be similar between men and women counterparts. These factors were agency, material conditions, low ecosystem dependence, education, occupational multiplicity and needs satisfaction (i.e. a poverty indicator) which was singularly important in women-headed households. While the factors themselves were similar in men and women–headed households, gendered differences were found regarding differing levels in the identified factors. Accordingly, the processes that underly the differences found should be addressed within initiatives seeking to understand and build adaptive capacity. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Almost all countries are experiencing disasters whose frequency and intensity have increased over the last decades due to many natural and anthropogenic factors, including climate change. These disasters are increasingly deadly, costly, uncertain, complex, and occurring over a range of temporal and spatial scales. They are the outcomes of inevitable hazards that affect highly vulnerable areas and populations with low coping capacities and resilience. The capacity to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to disaster risk is currently making a significant difference as to whether or not a natural hazard turns into a disaster. Presently, there is no region immune to the impacts of hazards and a country's vulnerability to disaster risk is the outcome of several factors, mainly the failure of its related governance system. Therefore, countries imperatively need to invest in disaster-resilience building, especially through the development of appropriate governance arrangements according to international frameworks while considering local context dynamics. Disaster resilience is understood here as the ability to adapt to and recover from hazards, shocks or stresses without compromising long-term prospects for development. This process, in order to be effective, requires the consideration of many issues, which will be investigated throughout this chapter, such as: the governance implications of the linkages between disaster risk reduction, climate change and sustainable development goals; the impacts of knowledge gap, uncertainty and science-decision divide; the dynamics through which stakeholder perceptions, awareness and involvement are shaped; the different relevant approaches to be mainstreamed; and the role of laws, policies, and regulations as critical tools in reducing and preventing disaster risk, thus fostering human security. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

	abstract = {Recently, the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) reiterated the need to stress the understanding of climate change adaptation from a gender perspective. This does not only call for integrating the gender dimension into existing conceptual frameworks, but also mainstreaming it to capture existing research gaps and drawing linkages on the themes of characteristics of climatic shock, attributes of affected systems and response characteristics, hence the focus of this chapter. Accordingly, this research set-out to contextualize the gender as a conceptual framework, test the hypothesis that gender is independent from an adaptation strategy and investigate the factors influencing the adaptation strategy. Chi-squared test of independence and multiple logistic regression analysis were employed. The chi squared test produced p-value as 0.216, hence no statistically significant association between gender and type of adaptation strategy was concluded. The regression analysis revealed that: women with a basic and advanced education are more likely to adopt autonomous adaptation strategy compared to women without education; access to information resulted in adoption of autonomous adaptation; and women with access to credit are less likely to adapt autonomously. Moreover, poor women are more likely to adopt autonomous adaptation strategy compared to rich women. Therefore, it is recommended that the adaptive capacity of women should be focused on in improving adaptation rather than external support. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

	abstract = {Purpose: Across societies, gendered climate response decisions remain top-down and have limited progress because the influenced risk dynamics and their interrelations are not adequately understood. This study aims to address this gap by proposing an interdisciplinary innovative method, called women climate vulnerability (WCV) index, for measuring and comparing a diverse range of risks that threaten to undermine the adaptive capacity and resilience of rural women. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on the literature to identify 12 risk categories across physical, economic and political sectors that affect rural women. These categories and attendant 51 risk indicators form the WCV index. A case study in Ben Tre Province (Vietnam) was used to demonstrate the application of the WCV methodology to rural contexts. The authors combined empirical, survey and secondary data from different sources to form data on the indicators. Structured expert judgment was used to address data gaps. Empirical and expert data were combined using a few weighting steps and a comprehensive coding system was developed to ensure objective evaluation. Findings: The WCV assessment results reveal a reasonably worrisome picture of women’s vulnerability in Ben Tre as top highest-likelihood and deepest-impact risks predominate in physical and economic risk sectors. Stability, human security and governance categories have lowest scores, demonstrating a fairly politically favourable condition in the province. The medium risk scores captured in land and infrastructure categories reveal promising determinants of the adaptation of women in this rural province. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the WCV index in collecting bottom-up data, evaluating a wide variety of risks that rural women face and pinpointing priority areas that need to be addressed. Originality/value: The WCV is systematic, customisable and localised. It combines field research and empirical data through structured expert judgment, thus enables researchers to fill data gaps and to do evidence-based assessment about diverse risk vulnerabilities. By doing so, the WCV index gives critical insights into the challenges that rural women face. This enables local governments to better understand cross-sectoral risks, pinpoint priority areas of action and timely channel funding and policy resources to support women where they need it most. © 2022, Quang N.M.},

	abstract = {“How to gauge the resilience of a household’s livelihood?” and “who is resilience for?”; as the world’s volatility increases, especially with unprecedented changes in climate, interest in these questions continues to rise. While many previous conventional attempts to measure resilience at the household level have largely employed the “objective” top-down framework relying mostly on a macro observed socioeconomic dataset, this present work seeks to estimate household resilience through an alternative bottom-up method, called the “subjective” resilience approach. With specific reference to the context of two ethnic Pa Cô and Tà Ôi minorities living in upland areas of Central Vietnam, this study aims to (1) measure household resilience to climate change by scoring five livelihood capitals, financial, human, social, physical, and natural, by applying the Household Livelihood Resilience (HLR) framework; and (2) provide an intersectional lens of ethnicity and gender in relation to the household’s livelihood resilience. To achieve these goals, in addition to two focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews, an empirical survey of 236 households was conducted between September to December 2021. Our findings indicated that there are differences in observed livelihood resilience among the ethnic minority groups and, within that, between gender (sex, status) factors. Ethnic women and poor households have a lower resilience than other groups in society due to their lower human capital and limited access to public and financial resources, which are to some degree linked to the difference in the gender division of labor and the cultural norms of patriarch traditions. This study highlights the importance of considering gender and poverty in resilience-building efforts and offers insights for future programs in multi-ethnic developing countries such as Vietnam. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As the climate crisis persists, there is a crucial need to increase knowledge on adaptive capacity and the underlying factors building it. This is particularly important for disadvantaged groups, such as coastal women in East Africa. Women’s livelihoods in these seascapes are and will be more severely affected by climate change and the capacity of East African states to deal with these challenges is limited in terms of financial and human capital. In this research, we investigated the underlying factors building the adaptive capacity of coastal women in Zanzibar (Unguja Island), Tanzania. Coastal women (N=117) were interviewed in villages around the island to gather information about potential factors supporting adaptive capacity. This was analysed applying Cinner et al (2018) five domains typology for adaptive capacity, i.e. assets, flexibility, organizations, learning and agency. The results show that women had relatively low adaptive capacity, extended poverty and very high dependence on seaweed farming of red algae, a livelihood providing low income and already being seriously affected by climate variability and change. Women’s observations of key variables related to environmental changes corresponded to most scientific findings. It was, however, unclear how that knowledge is useful and enhances adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity was generally low but individual differences were found in which ten women had a high income. The results show that the factors underlying adaptive capacity are complex and interact with each other, being positive, negative and unclear. Many of the identified factors deserve future research. This study adds to the pool of knowledge by addressing women (not only men); coastal ecosystems (as land and freshwater systems are more studied) and the individual level (since most studies focus on national and community levels). The study illustrates that institutional renewal, bridging and cooperation is possible in Zanzibar bringing good news to the region.

It is therefore important to understand the underlying issues of intersectionality for climate change adaptation and human well-being. This paper aims to measure human capabilities and freedom of choice by analyzing perceived climate change impacts and current climate change adaptation ability among ethnic and non-ethnic communities in Bangladesh. This study applies a range of participatory rural appraisal tools and key informant interviews to assess impacts of climate change when considering gender and ethnicity. Women in the coastal regions have less access to resources and services because of social capital and cultural practices and this directly or indirectly influences their adaptation to climate change. Women have limited or no participation in decision-making processes at family or community levels and this impacts their vulnerability and well-being. In consequence, women’s capabilities must be focused on moderating their vulnerability and risk, and developing effective adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change and natural hazards. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, Zimbabwe has experienced several climate-induced extreme events such as droughts, floods, heat waves and cold spells–all of which have challenged the education sector’s resilience to climatic shocks. At the same time, adolescent girls in rural communities continue to ‘fall through the cracks’ of education–failing to attend school, to stay in school and to complete a basic cycle of education. Climate change appears to be a limiting factor for girls in rural areas in addition to other barriers such as household poverty, distances travelled to and from school and gender-based violence. Based on a research study underpinned by human development, African feminist, and actor-oriented theory, this article explores the link between climate change and adolescent girls’ education in Ward 25 of Chivi District, an arid and remote rural region in southwest Zimbabwe. The study population consisted of rural, in-school, adolescent girls aged 10-19 years, whose families reside in or originate from the study area. Data was generated through a qualitative survey administered to twenty-one adolescent girls; sixteen key informant interviews with stakeholders at different levels; and eight focus group discussions (FGDs) with adolescent girls, adolescent boys, teachers and caregivers. Data was also generated through field notes, field observation, photography as well as drawings by adolescent girls. The findings highlight how climatic shocks pose challenges for adolescent girls’ education in rural contexts and the current and potential roles played by the adolescent girls and other actors in addressing climate change. By challenging the narrative that adolescent girls are victims of the climate crisis, this study positions adolescent girls’ agency as a game changer in locally led climate action. © 2023 E.

Over the years of operation, Project Harvest's women's leadership formation participants consistently report increased ability to organize within their community, engage in their human right to access nutritious food, and define their own adaptive community plans to address food insecurity that responds to climate change. Women are often the most vulnerable to climate change impacts in rural traditional communities, as they are typically home throughout the year and therefore responsible for household family diet and health. By establishing relationships between community members, local NGOs, intragovernment and international development organizations, the potential exists to broaden transformative change for rural subsistence families to address the widespread and ongoing effects of poverty, gender inequity, climate change, and food insecurity. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

It describes how FIRE has been developed, tested and refined over the course of a five-year regional learning and technical cooperation programme in Asia. Recognising that both HRBA and gender equality approaches have informed development initiatives for decades, this article identifies limitations addressed by FIRE. Acknowledging the critical role of civil society in advocating for change on behalf of disadvantaged groups, we highlight the importance of a framework that supports state actors to practically integrate human rights and gender equality into operations at national and sub-national levels. Reflecting a consolidation of international standards and guidelines and a systematic integration of gender equality perspectives with an emphasis on practical utility, we argue that FIRE can be used at multiple levels of governance by state as well as non-state actors for enhancing DRR, CCA and sustainable development outcomes. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study determined the differences in the perception and choice of adaptation strategies between men and women farmers in Cinzana in the Segou region of Mali. The study used questionnaire interviews involving 260 farmers (49% women) and focus group discussions for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model to understand the determinants of the level of adoption of adaptation strategies. The results showed that, irrespective of gender, majority of farmers perceived climate change as extended period of droughts, shortened duration of rains, increased frequency of strong winds and increased day and night temperatures. While climate change perception was similar between men and women, choice of adaptation strategies differed significantly in most instances. Women farmers were generally low adopters of crop and varieties-related strategies, soil and water conservation technics (contour farming, use of organic manure), etc., compare to men. Notably, being the household head, age and the availability of free labor were found to positively increased farmers’ probability of adopting many adaptation strategies. The study recommends improving women’s access and control of production resources (land, labor) as means to improving their adoption of adaptation strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

It is, therefore, crucial to understand whether there exists a gender gap in climate change adaptation and investigate the factors explaining the gap to reduce the vulnerability of the farming households to surging climatic risks. Using data from 2279 farm households in Ethiopia and applying a multivariate probit model and exogenous switching treatment effect regression method, this study examines the existing gender gap in climate change adaptations among farmers in Ethiopia and factors contributing to this relationship. The results show a significant gender gap in climate change adaptation in farming households due to the differences in both observable and unobservable characteristics of male- and female-headed households. It indicates that reducing the gap can enhance climate change adaptation by female-headed households by almost 19%. Women's workload in household chores significantly reduces their likelihood to adopt climate change adaptation measures. Therefore, unless policies proposed target institutional factors, including social and cultural barriers, traditional gender norms and division of labor, and other intrinsic behavioral issues, addressing only observed characteristics may not fully address the gender gap. To bring about transformational changes in the existing gender norms and social attitudes, long-term gender-informed policies are essential, along with short-term projects, to address the gender gap in climate change adaptation through the provision of equitable opportunities for all. © 2022 United Nations.},

A critical discourse analysis was carried out on texts of climate change adaptation projects implemented during 2009-2020 in rural Bangladesh. This article argues that gender is currently not considered enough in climate action and that gender discourses focus primarily on ‘women’s participation, more precisely, ‘women’s presence in poverty reduction and empowerment projects. The discourses reinscribe to the long-established economic priorities of development rather than exploring new dimensions to challenge social norms that define perpetual gender inequalities. This study suggests that greater attention is required to address the gender realities of non-binary categories, ethnic groups, non-poor social classes, and religious minorities to effectively plan and implement adaptation projects to support the diverse needs of vulnerable people. © 2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

This affects household's adaptive capacity to climate change negatively. Household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interview and workshop were used to track stakeholders' opinions on gender disparity in agriculture and policy issues. The objective of the study was to assess the gender parity index in agriculture, resource governance patterns and how these impact the capacity to climate change adaptation. The results show wives were imparity with their husbands. The parity gap on ownership, access to, and decision-making power over agricultural equipment was as wide as 59% and this affects women's adaptation capacity to climate change impacts. Indeed, 94% of the coupled households have got their land by redistribution and inheritance land acquisition forms by which both forms of acquiring land favored the husband. Half of the respondent households acknowledged that they have already acquired certification for their farmlands. However, the certification was mostly given by the names of husbands and in few cases by both. Certification of farmlands by the name of a wife and a husband has built confidence on ownership and manage their farmlands. This has helped a household to better adapt climate change impacts. Gender disparity in agricultural productive resources combined with policy and cultural distortions could exacerbate household's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. This indicates the need for gender mainstreaming in climate change policy reforms and formulation so as to empower women and build their adaptive capacity. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Understanding and closing the gender gap in environmental concern is the only way to identify and implement the best policies for the environment and sustainable development. This paper examines the gender difference in environmental concern in the case of Ethiopia, Oromia regional state. For this, 140 individuals are sampled from the study areas. The result reveals that women play triple role in their communities: reproductive role, productive role, and community roles. The result also shows that women are more likely to depend on natural resources and hence more likely vulnerable to climate change effects. However, there is no statistically significant difference between women and men in terms of climate change awareness and choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The estimated logit model predicts that women are 31.25 times more likely to participate in environmental conservation than men. Increase in the daily work load by 1 hour is more likely to reduce the individual participation in environmental conservation by 0.237 times. The result also shows that increase in livestock possession decreases individual participation in environmental conservations. A number of policy implications are drawn. There is a need to increase the incentive and distribution of improved cooking stoves and biogas so as to decrease the women work loads. There is also a need to engage civil society organizations, government institutions, and relevant women’s networks to ensure inclusive approaches to the implementation of gender-responsive forest policies. Finally, the regional government is advised to organize gender-awareness seminars and workshops for forestry officials, including decision-makers and policy committee members. © 2022 The Author(s).

Quantitative data were analyzed with frequencies and chi-square tests, whereas qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Findings: The results showed that elderly smallholder farmers’ knowledge of climate variability and climate change were based on their sex, level of formal education and experience in farming. Elderly smallholder farmers adopted both on-farm and off-farm strategies to cope with climate change and variability. The vulnerability of elderly smallholder farmers to climate change calls for social protection mechanisms such as a pension scheme that guarantees access to monthly cash transfers. Such a scheme will ease constraints to livelihood and ensure improved well-being. Originality/value: Elderly smallholder farmers have remained invisible in discourses on perceptions and adaptation to climate change despite the surge in number of this category of farmers. This paper therefore represents an attempt to highlight the experiences of elderly smallholder farmers with climate variability and change. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The article is based on ethnographic fieldwork in the expert community in Dhaka and in a climate change adaptation field site in coastal Bangladesh. Following Ananya Roy’s work, I understand coastal Bangladesh to be a riskscape, a geographical space suffused with imaginations of anticipated risks that must be managed through disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Roy further argues that riskscapes create new subjects of risk, and that such subjects are highly gendered because development has tended to focus on poor women ‘in very specific ways’. In this article, I build on Roy’s insights to explore how women are constructed as ‘subjects of risk’ in climate change adaptation. I also show how climate change adaptation, in becoming the new buzzword for development, continues to focus on poor women in very specific ways, which are applied to fit with the climate change ‘metacode’. While well-intended, the understanding of women as subjects of risk is imbued with ambivalence, because it may contribute to supporting structures that make women vulnerable by normalizing relations of risk. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, using primary and secondary data sources to analyse the effect of climate shocks on women farmers. The study finds that women farmers in both communities are experiencing significant impacts on their livelihoods due to climate change, resulting in increased poverty incidence. The study recommends that future action plans dedicated to climate change adaptation should not be standalone. Still, it should form part of a national and sub-national strategy aimed at poverty reduction and improving livelihood, especially for women. Additionally, the paper recommends collating specific meteorological data in an inexpensive and easily understandable form and expanding extension services to ensure proper targeting of small women farmers. The study also suggests using crop diversification through a land transformation scheme to mitigate against low rainfall, with women farmers potentially serving as sharecroppers within larger farms. The paper concludes by emphasising the importance of sustaining supply and demand-driven initiatives stipulated in the plan and ensuring the political will to allocate land to women farmers. Overall, the study highlights the need for gender-sensitive policies and strategies that account for the unique vulnerabilities of women farmers in the face of climate change, especially for future adaptation strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Today, in response to intersecting pressures from climate change, soil fertility loss, and socioeconomic change associated with globalization, these farmers are working to build more resilient livelihood systems. This study examines farmers' perceptions of environmental change and socioeconomic transition in Senegal and the drivers and constraints on their adaptive responses, with particular attention to the interplay of on- and non-farm livelihood strategies amid concerns about changing weather. Semi-structured interviews with 47 farmers provide insight into individual lived experiences while surveys and multinomial regression drawing data from approximately 500 farmers point to broader patterns in perceptions and adaptive strategies. The findings indicate that most Senegalese farmers perceive substantial environmental change that is amplifying ongoing processes of agrarian change, increasing reliance on non-farm livelihoods and youth migration in particular. While the most resource-constrained farmers rely primarily on prayer—likely an expression of limited alternative strategies—those most concerned about weather changes turn to diversified livelihood strategies. This study illustrates an evolving relationship between farmers and non-farm work amid environmental and socioeconomic change in rural Africa, with implications for development initiatives aimed at supporting farmer adaptation to climate change. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Using a non-unitary household model and fitting an empirical adoption model for men and women individually and jointly, we examine how gender-based ownership, management and control of resources are correlated with adoptions of a portfolio of climate change adaptation strategies. Our analysis is based on recent household survey data with detailed household plot-level information about adaptation strategies, plot ownership, farm management decisions, and the right to control outputs from the plots among spouses within the household. The observed patterns of women's ownership, management and economic rights of land suggest that all are important aspects of women's bargaining power. We found compelling evidence regarding the overlapping effects of the different gender-linked-land-based rights on the adoption of a portfolio of adaptation strategies. The empirical findings emphasize the importance of incorporating gender-based intra-household interactions and joint resource ownership and decision making in climate change adaptation. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Climate-induced disasters affect a wide range of communities in Bangladesh. Among them, women are the most affected groups. Climate change increases their socioeconomic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their families’ food security, water consumption, health, and overall livelihood. Unlike in many patriarchal societies, Bangladeshi women often face challenges of unequal social relations and hierarchies, which enforce gender differented vulnerabilities. In this context, this paper intends to reveal what barriers Bangladeshi women face and how they cope with many uncertainties relating to changing contexts, particularly at the household, community, and institutional levels. The paper draws from the author’s Ph.D. research which was carried out in four districts of Bangladesh, focused on four types of climate change impacts and adaptation practices. Qualitative data collection methods were used such as focus group discussions, in-depth Interviews with women, and observations of their household and community-level activities for the study. In addition to that, key informant interviews were conducted with local and national level experts, government officials, and development workers to reveal institutional barriers confronted by women. Findings explore women’s gendered struggles in preparing for and responding to climate change through their lived experiences. Moreover, the study sheds light on the limited gender-responsive environment drawing attention to the need for strategies and actions for gender-transformative approaches to develop climate-resilient households and communities with women at the center. © 2022 Asian Institute of Technology.},

Five key informants from the eThekwini (Durban) metropolitan municipality were also interviewed. Findings from the study showed that although there is improved economic development in the selected settlements, which constitute informal settlements designated for Black South Africans during the apartheid era, such an economic development approach has not significantly improved the livelihoods and adaptive capacity of the local women.

	abstract = {We explore how seed systems enhance access to seeds, and information for climate-change adaptation in farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, as well as how gender-driven roles and institutional dynamics influence the process. Men and women farmers equally experience climate-change related effects, including drought, short rainy seasons and increased pest and disease incidence. Our study relies on exploratory data analysis of 1001 households surveyed in four sites in 2016. Farmers surveyed preferred early-maturing, heat-tolerant, high-yielding, and pest-and disease-resistant varieties, all important climate-adaptive traits. Seed systems of the focus crops studied are largely informal—overall, 68% women and 62% men use their own seed, indicating women’s higher reliance on ‘informal’ seed and information sources. Only 21% of respondents reported interacting with seed experts who are affiliated with formal organizations. Both formal and informal organizations play a key role in providing access to climate-adapted seed/information, with access for men and women varying across the countries studied. There is a need to support further development of those connections, building on existing social networks. We conclude that inclusive and gender-responsive context-and country-specific seed interventions will ensure equitable outcomes, increase women’s empowerment and strengthen both formal and informal seed systems for more effective climate-change adaptation. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The adverse effects of climate change cut across several sectors of the economy and are mostly felt in rural communities, especially among indigenous people in the developing world. Furthermore, the perils related to climate change threaten to reinforce gender inequalities that partly emanate from unequal distribution and restricted rights to resources to cope with climate change that see women—especially female-headed households—often being disadvantaged. Such unfortunate circumstances in the agricultural sector could erode progress made towards gender equality. Because Central Africa is one of the regions highly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions in sub-Saharan Africa that threatens the existence and livelihoods of indigenous people, this chapter examines how indigenous women are vulnerable to climate change and how they adapt by adopting a systematic review of existing literature. The findings revealed that differentiated gender roles at household level and patriarchy are some factors that make indigenous women in Central Africa more vulnerable to climate change than their male counterparts. In addition, the findings suggested that social capital and community-based adaptation solutions have the potential to curb the gender divide that makes indigenous women more vulnerable to climate change than their male counterparts through network building. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {This paper uses climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Kenya as an empirical entry point for investigating how climate actions reshape or reinforce gender relations, and how they are aimed at improving local resilience that is nested in such relations. While enhancing national food security, CSA practices could however reproduce inequitable power relations, such as gendered authority relations that produce vulnerability and inequalities. Equity and knowledge represent particularly contested aspects of CSA because it largely fails to address who wins and who loses from such interventions, who are able to participate while others are excluded, and whose knowledge and perspectives count in decision-making processes. Gender relations provide a stark illustration of the way that CSA fails to address how enduring inequalities of access in both production and consumption shape who is rendered vulnerable to climate change and who is left food insecure. In this paper, we treat CSA projects as a site of tensions between stability and contestation of gender relations, brought into view through moments where practices and knowledges are (re)shaped. We first review the concepts of authority, recognition, and resilience as a framework to understand how gendered inequalities and struggles over rights to resources are perpetuated within adaptation and resilience responses to climate variability. We analyze evidence from past studies regarding rural adaptation processes and gender dimensions in CSA projects to identify how such projects may modify the space for renegotiating inequitable gender relations. We approach gender relations as authority relations that are constantly internalized, resisted, and contested through practices and interactions between different actors associated with CSA projects, and the different knowledges that direct these practices. The examination focuses on Kenya as an empirical context to gain sufficient depth in understanding the social and political processes in which climate actions and gender relations are nested, enabling us to identify key points of intersection within these two themes. In addition, gendered dimensions of rural resource governance and adaptation are relatively well-described in Kenya, providing lessons for how climate actions can become more gender-responsive.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of a rapid review of the literature on gender and coastal climate adaptation. The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) highlighted some of the major ways in which gender inequality interacts with coastal climate change. However, the report does not consider how gender interacts with adaptation interventions. This review was driven the need to understand these dynamics in more detail as well as deepen the understanding of how coastal climate adaptation affects the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Our analysis is based on a screening of over 1,000 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2020. The results were strongly populated by natural science publications leading to very low coverage of gender as a social dimension of adaptation. Of the papers reviewed, a mere 2.6% discussed gender and often only in a cursory manner. While the literature surveyed does not allow us to close the gap present in the SROCC in any meaningful way, the results do provide important new insights from the literature that does exist. Of particular note is the fact that adaptation measures may have positive and negative gender outcomes currently invisible under the SDG5 framework. We conclude that there is a need to collect gender-disaggregated data on coastal adaptation efforts and to review SDG5 targets and indicators to ensure that the gender dimensions of climate adaptation are fully captured and accounted for.

The paper uses the Adaptation Learning Programme as a case to explore this nexus. The Adaptation Learning Programme was a gender-integrated community-based adaptation programme implemented from 2010 to 2015 in Garissa County in Kenya. Methods: A case study methodology with an interpretivist epistemological approach was chosen to explore the complexity underlying the unique context of the Adaptation Learning Programme‘s implementation in Garissa. Data was collected from grey literature published and was analysed using a systematic framework. Results: Adaptation Learning Programme community-based adaptation interventions enhanced adaptive capacity, through enhancing women's access to markets and economic assets, teaching women adaptive agricultural practices, including women in decision-making processes, and disseminating gender-sensitive climate information to communities. These processes mitigated several climate-related health risks faced by women in Garissa, but also failed to address the structural causes of their health vulnerabilities. The findings can be scaled up to inform further community-based adaptations and national policies on gender-sensitive approaches to climate change. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study explored the use of conservation agriculture (CA) as a climate adaptation strategy among smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. Using 761 household interviews and 33 focus group discussions (FGDs) with smallholder farmers from six districts, data was collected on how smallholder farmers in the region experience climate change, what CA practices they had adopted, and benefits and challenges associated with CA practice. Results show that men and women farmers had similar experiences of climate change, namely late onset of a shortened rainy season, intra-seasonal drought and higher temperatures. Farmers' perceptions of gender-mediated effects of climate change had important nuances. The three most cited effects of climate change on women mentioned by women were lower crop yields, outbreaks of armyworms and reduced livestock fodder. The men thought women were most affected by increased hunger, lower crop yields and reduced domestic water sources. According to the women FGDs, men were most affected through reduced crop yields, increases in livestock diseases and increased hunger. The men self-reported reduced crop yields, reduced water for livestock and outbreaks of armyworms. Both men and women saw CA as having climate change adaptation benefits. For the women, men most benefitted from CA through the high moisture holding capacity of basins, higher crop yields and reduced labor requirements through use of oxen ripping. The men most appreciated the high crop yields, improved soil fertility and reduced costs as less fertilizer is used. The women cited the high moisture holding capacity of basins, high crop yields and improved soil fertility as benefits they most commonly derived from CA, while the men thought the women most benefitted from CA through the higher crop yields, improved soil fertility and crop tolerance to droughts. The study concludes that there is room for CA to serve as a climate smart agricultural system for both men and women smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. However, this will require addressing important challenges of high weed pressure, high labor demands, and low access to manure, and CA farming implements. The CA package for Zambia should include access to timely climate information and climate informed crop choices. Copyright © 2021 Umar.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence that Indigenous peoples’ multiple subjectivities engender diverse lived experiences both between and within Indigenous groups, the influence of multiple subjectivities on Indigenous peoples’ vulnerability and adaptation to climate change is largely un-explored. Drawing on ethnographic research with Indigenous Māori women in Aotearoa New Zealand, this paper provides empirical evidence that subjectivity-mediated power dynamics operating within Indigenous societies (at the individual and household scale) are important determinants of vulnerability and adaptation which should be considered in both scholarship and policy. Using an intersectional framework, I demonstrate how different Māori women and their whānau (families) live, cope with, and adapt to the embodied physical and emotional health effects of climate change in radically different ways because of their subject positionings, even though they belong to the same community, hapū (sub-tribe), or iwi (tribe). In underlining these heterogenous experiences, I provide an avenue for reconsidering how climate adaptation scholarship, policies, and practices might better engage with the complex, amorphous realities within Māori and other Indigenous communities. I argue it is possible to develop more inclusive, tailored, and sustainable adaptation that considers divergent vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities within Indigenous communities, groups, and societies and supports customised vulnerability-reduction strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper seeks to critically examine how gendered relations at the household level influence access to social networks for climate change adaptation in northwestern Ghana. By doing so, the study contributes to an improved understanding of how inter-gender dynamics shape adaptive capacities among vulnerable groups. Using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews, a total sample size of 156 respondents were studied. The study also employed an intersectional framework and a network analysis to examine the nuanced networks of smallholder farmer households. Findings revealed that the interplay of age, marital status and educational levels influenced access to social networks for support in minimising climate risk. As such, promoting adaptation actions without addressing structural and relational inequalities within vulnerable communities may deepen existing inequalities. © 2021 The Authors},

To do so, a selection model generalizing the Heckman (1979) approach and the Oaxaca and Blinder decomposition procedure are specified and estimated. The empirical analysis is based on intra-agricultural household data from the 2018 Harmonized Household Living Conditions Survey (EHCVM) of Togo with a total sample of 8622 maize plots disaggregated by seasonThe results reveal that the average maize productivity of men is about 23.5% higher than that of women. Similarly, the average maize productivity of married women is about 28.5% higher than that of unmarried women. This suggests that married men and women have greater adaptive capacity than their counterparts and are also more likely to improve their productivity. The factors that contribute to the performance of married men and women at the expense of their counterparts are secondary education, producer assets, and climate information. We also find that the use of improved seeds, off-season cropping, and a combination of both strategies are the types of coping strategies adopted by men and married women to increase their productivity. These results have implications for the direction of development policies. These development policies can be more targeted at unmarried women. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Many rural communities in Cameroon rely on natural sources of water (rivers, springs, and rainfall) for agriculture and domestic use. Access to and reliability of water from these sources depend on changes in rainfall and temperatures. Household roles in Cameroon are traditionally defined along gender lines, with women playing key roles in food production, home management, and caregiving. Water is indispensable for women to successfully accomplish these roles. Climate variability is affecting reliability of water in Cameroon; however, impacts are not the same for men and women in rural communities. This paper examines how climate-induced water challenges adversely affect women's ability to perform their multiple roles in a predominantly farming community in southwest Cameroon. Data collected by survey from a hundred women, supplemented by interviews with local water and agricultural technicians, suggest that climate change has contributed to the disappearance of several water sources and decreased volume of others. This hampers local water availability, compromises women's productivity, and increases the burden on women's triple roles as farmers, caregivers, and home managers. Although individual women are implementing some adaptation strategies, comprehensive public policy measures, including promotion of better land use management and gender-sensitive technologies, are vital to sustain efforts against climate change in Cameroon. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change poses a significant threat to indigenous societies and cultures in the South Pacific. Within these societies, women and indigenous cultures need increased representation in climate change assessment and adaptation strategy development. To capture the diversity of effects and maximize creative approaches to address climate change we studied how gender influences perceptions of climate change in response to climate-related environmental change, adaptation strategies, and the perception of adaptation strategies that are currently in place. To explore diverse perceptions, we conducted semi-structured interviews in four villages in Savaii, Samoa. The interviews were analyzed and quantified around three main themes: climate-related environmental changes, adaptation strategies, and perceptions of existing adaptation approaches. Each participant's response was quantified based on perceived priority ranging from 0—no priority/no mention, to 3—highest priority/frequent mention. We found that each participant was aware of climate-related environmental changes and gender and village roles bring variation in perceptions of climate change. We found that men felt high temperatures and marine management were of greatest concern while women cared about storms and related danger and pollution control. Our results indicate that females and female village roles had significantly lower understanding and enthusiasm for in-place adaptation strategies due to a lack of involvement in the implementation and upkeep of adaptation strategies. This study argues that climate-related adaptation strategies should put village role and gender-based perceptions into consideration and increase representation in policymaking for sustainable climate change adaptation. © 2022 The Authors},

Changes in climate parameters, gender-based perceptions of climate, as well as gender-based response and adaptation practices were assessed in accordance with specific research objectives. A total of 200 participants were surveyed through a mixed method approach using 41 years of climate data. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered equally in the two States and 52 in-depth interviews were conducted within male and female farmers that were 40 years and above age using a purposive sampling method. Results from Nassarawa State showed a downward trend in rainfall and an upward trend in both minimum and maximum temperatures. The farmers perceived climate change differently, with observed changes in climate variables: temperature and precipitation, resulting in extreme floods, drought, and rainfall onset and leading to varying adaptation practices. The study concluded that gender plays a significant role in the adoption of adaptation practices in the agricultural sector and that males often have more access to resources and decision-making power in farming as the heads of households. There is a need for better gender-sensitive approaches to adaptation planning and implementation to ensure that both men and women have equal opportunities to benefit from adaptation options in agriculture. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Instead, we conducted a nuanced analysis of self-assessments provided by 364 household heads in the Nam Dong District, Thua Thien Hue Province, Vietnam, to gain a comprehensive understanding of household resilience. Our investigation focused on two upland communities—the Kinh majority and Co Tu ethnic minority households—evaluating their resilience levels in terms of the five livelihood capitals and identifying significant disparities among different ethnic and gender groups. Our findings reveal notable differences in livelihood resilience to climate change and variability among these groups, particularly for women, the poor, and ethnic minorities who exhibit lower resilience levels. This underscores the need for policies and programs designed to improve resilience capacity while taking into account these groups’ cultural and social norms. We suggest focusing on improving financial, human, and social capitals to increase households’ resilience to external shocks. Specifically, building resilience for disadvantaged groups must go hand in hand with promoting their overall well-being and alleviating poverty. Additionally, we recommend tailored training programs to raise awareness among households and strengthening institutional systems to enhance overall resilience. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services play a crucial role in promoting public and environmental health as well as social and economic development. At the global level, particularly in the developing world, WASH issues continue to present significant challenges. These challenges have been further intensified by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, climate change, water scarcity, and rising inequality. The scientific community has actively engaged in constructive discussions on these issues, as evidenced by the notable research findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to comprehensively examine and evaluate global knowledge on WASH. To search for relevant publications, the Scopus database was utilized using specific terms associated with WASH. VOSviewer 1.6.18 software was employed to generate network visualization maps, which assessed collaborative patterns and research trends in the field of WASH. The research output of countries was adjusted considering their gross domestic product (GDP) and population size. The total number of WASH-related publications, including all types of documents, was 1805. By narrowing the search to articles and reviews, the overall global productivity yielded 1589 documents: 1367 (86.0%) original articles and 222 (14.0%) review articles. The USA had the highest number of WASH publications (n = 668; 42.0%), followed by the UK (n = 396; 24.9%), Switzerland (n = 151; 9.5%), and Australia (n = 141; 8.9%). Ethiopia emerged as the leading country in terms of GDP per capita and the number of publications, followed by Uganda, Malawi, India, and Bangladesh. The USA, the UK, and Switzerland exhibited the most extensive collaboration among countries. The main research areas encompassed the role of WASH in sustainable development, the impacts of inadequate access to WASH services on gender equality, children, infants, and the outbreak of COVID-19 and other diseases, as well as the significance of hygiene practices and community and school-based WASH interventions in reducing infections. This study provides a novel analysis of global WASH-related research and highlights the distribution of outcomes across nations. Continued and increased collaboration between developed and developing nations will facilitate the sharing of responsibility for WASH research outcomes and the implementation of effective policies. © 2023.

	abstract = {This study has been conducted to identify vulnerabilities and effects of climate change on women in 12 unions in Shyamnagar upazila in the Satkhira district in the Southwestern Coastal Region of Bangladesh (SWCRB). Climate vulnerability and gender inequality may increase due to climate change. Women may, thus, face specific conditions of vulnerability in society and daily livelihood. This paper focuses on investigating factors that influence women’s vulnerability from climate change, their adaptations, and the importance of women empowerment to reduce their inequality in SWCRB. This study also emphasizes gender inequality caused by climate change, and looks at accommodations for women to reduce hostile influences of climate change. From the 9 unions in SWCRB, a total of 320 household respondents were randomly selected to complete a questionnaire. The results of the statistical analysis showed that most of the survey’s perimeter has significant. Interviews, case studies, focus group discussions, workshops, and key informant interviews were also conducted from 12 unions, and it was found that climate change impacts men and women differently, with women being more vulnerable than men. Through case study this paper investigated the main factors influencing the vulnerability of women. In terms of empowerment women may also be well positioned to lead adaptation efforts alongside men, as this analysis represent that gender inequalities are leading by social norms. Women being more vulnerable both in short-term i.e., major natural disasters, cyclones, flood, and long-term i.e., sea level rise, salinity intrusion in water and soil, land erosion, droughts, climatic events, as they enhance gender inequalities. Further, gender inequality is seen in illiteracy, food shortages and poor health conditions, traditional norms, religious taboos, and patriarchy. Moreover, gender-based economic opportunities, women’s mobility, and income are changing, while household authority relations and gender-based socio-economic, cultural, and institutional constraints remain. This study examines the increased vulnerability of women in SWCRB to climate change, which can be mitigated through women empowerment; female involvement with environmentally friendly stoves, rural electrification and renewable energy development, microfinancing, and nakshikantha. (Nakshikantha is a special type of sewing art that is made by creating designs with different types of colored threads on plain stitches). Lastly, women may also lead adaptation efforts alongside men, make decisions, and promote their participation. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the narratives of women’s resilience in disaster from the post-colonial feminism approach. Ecological justice and gender issues have been addressed by other studies on Indonesia to amplify the voices of Indonesian women, but few of them focus on women’s narratives. As a culture relying on oral traditions, Indonesian women’s narratives and stories are instrumental in decolonizing the knowledge on ecological justice. Even though feminist perspectives play an instrumental role in addressing ecological justice in Indonesia, studies using post-colonial feminism remain very limited. This study employs post-colonial feminist ethnography and focuses on women's position on the watershed governance policy in three areas in Bengkulu, Indonesia: Rindu Hati village represents rural upstream location; Talang Empat village represents the rural midstream region, and Tanjung Jaya village represents the downstream urban areas. Interviews were conducted with women who were members of peasant groups, agricultural workers, traders, village administrators, and other community members. The narratives show several important trends: (a) Women’s daily live reflects their knowledge about the environment and women’s responses to disaster and climate change indicating local eco-consciousness, resilience, and adaptation to changes. (b) Local power configuration contributes to resilience. There are interconnections of gender relations, disaster resilience, and environmental sustainability. Local power map shows the interconnection between disaster responses, environmental sustainability, and gender relations in the community. (c) Upstream population tends to have higher commitment to environmental conservation and disaster resilience compared to the communities in the midstream and downstream locations. Women’s position in the circle of power in watershed management has important influence in their resilience facing disaster and climate change. These narratives inform the interrelations of women’s positions, disaster resilience, and eco-consciousness in creating ecological justice. © 2023, University of Indonesia Faculty of Law.

Consequently, understanding how adaptation and coping strategies impact pastoral women's well-being is critical for supporting the climate resilience of communities and the landscapes on which they rely. We used a household survey, guided by a multi-dimensional framework of well-being, to investigate how the use of drought-related coping and adaptation strategies by Samburu households influenced livestock loss and women's well-being in northern Kenya. Coping and adaptation strategies predicted numerous social-cognitive components of well-being, although not livestock loss. We conjecture these results are a product of a gendered division of labor within households and the community. We argue that interventions aimed at supporting drought resilience must consider the gendered implications of climate response strategies, multiple indicators for evaluation, and the influence of community and place. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change effects cause major socioeconomic challenges for marginalized groups, particularly women, in Bangladesh. Specifically, drought increases resource scarcity, causing social problems that impact women, which can be described as the gendered sociocultural construction of vulnerabilities. Given this constructed dimension of gender-based vulnerability, this paper explores the effects of drought on marginalized women in one local case study, namely Badlagaree village in Gaibandha district, Bangladesh. To examine this linkage, we collected qualitative primary data using ethnographic research methods, primarily focus group discussions. Findings show that gender-based vulnerability is increasing due to growing drought effects, including agricultural production loss. Marginalized women, because of their gender identity, encounter these drought effects through unemployment, food insecurity, illiteracy, early marriage, dowry costs and violence. While further national-scale research is required, this paper argues that in order to overcome such gender-based vulnerability, current development policies, social programs, and adaptation strategies should better recognize such social dynamics. Further, a gender-specific understanding requires incorporation into adaptation policies through greater collaborative governance as an important prerequisite for sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Peruvian Andes has experienced widely publicized, climate change induced glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which increasingly threaten the lives of thousands of the region's residents. However, the everyday adaptations of the most historically marginalized populations in the Andes—often Quechua women in highland communities—are frequently obscured by a singular focus on glacier and water management to prevent high-impact but infrequent GLOFs. This focus on glacier hazards downplays and renders invisible the ways that Quechua women actually adapt to climate change by labeling them 'highly vulnerable' despite a limited understanding of their daily lives. Through a case study in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this article advances a feminist framework of everyday adaptation called ‘futuremaking’ that challenges the current ice-and-water-focused paradigm of adaptation policy in glaciated regions. We draw on interviews with Quechua women, participant observation on adaptation planning teams, and informal expert interviews to advance the futuremaking framework, which prioritizes the everyday and future desires of women and households over technical adaptations that view people as vulnerable. Futuremaking is a feminist process of everyday adaptation in a disaster zone that relies on A) Prioritizing the everyday over the someday; B) Intergenerational well-being and community networks of care, and; C) Dynamic and embodied adaptations to uncertainty. We argue that futuremaking both challenges the efficacy of adaptation projects currently underway in the Andes and charts a path towards more transformative adaptation interventions by prioritizing capabilities and feminist networks of care over managing damage and disaster. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change impacts are being felt across sectors in all regions of the world, and adaptation projects are being implemented to reduce climate risks and existing vulnerabilities. Climate adaptation actions also have significant synergies and tradeoffs with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality. Questions are increasingly being raised about the gendered and climate justice implications of different adaptation options. This paper investigates if reported climate change adaptation actions are contributing to advancing the goal of gender equality (SDG 5) or not. It focuses on linkages between individual targets of SDG 5 and climate change adaptation actions for nine major sectors where transformative climate actions are envisaged. The assessment is based on evidence of adaptation actions documented in 319 relevant research publications published during 2014–2020. Positive links to nine targets under SDG 5 are found in adaptation actions that are consciously designed to advance gender equality. However, in four sectors—ocean and coastal ecosystems; mountain ecosystems; poverty, livelihood, sustainable development; and industrial system transitions, we find more negative links than positive links. For adaptation actions to have positive impacts on gender equality, gender-focused targets must be intentionally brought in at the prioritisation, designing, planning, and implementation stages. An SDG 5+ approach, which takes into consideration intersectionality and gender aspects beyond women alone, can help adaptation actions move towards meeting gender equality and other climate justice goals. This reflexive approach is especially critical now, as we approach the mid-point in the timeline for achieving the SDGs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

It plays a vital role in understanding ordinary people's decisions in fundamental aspects related to their daily activities.

Over the past few decades, the international community has witnessed an increasing interest in capturing and analyzing indigenous knowledge and practices as a foundation for local sustainable development. Coupled with the increasing popularity of participatory approaches to decision-making and grassroots movements, the cross-cultural understanding of indigenous knowledge systems has now become a cornerstone for charting climate change adaptation strategies, reducing hazard risks, and promoting biodiversity and conservation practices to support community resilience.

	abstract = {[Background] Climate change has resulted in long-term impacts on human health. Implementing efficient adaptation strategies among primary healthcare facilities is well determined by whether staff of different genders recognize the health risks related to climate change and are willing to take active measures. [Objective] To investigate gender differences on perceptions of health risks and attitude towards adaptation strategies among primary healthcare workers in China, and provide relevant suggestions. [Methods] By adopting a multi-stage cluster sampling method, we selected 21 urban and 10 rural healthcare facilities in Guangdong Province to collect information with a questionnaire. Then chi-square test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression analysis were used to explore the gender differences in climate change-related health risk cognition, knowledge acquisition channels, attitudes towards adaptation strategies, main obstacles, and resource requirements among the healthcare workers. [Results] Of 733 participants, 38.47% (282 participants) were male and 61.53% (451 participants) were female. The percentages of male healthcare workers who agreed that climate change is happening and recognized the causes of climate change (70.21%, 60.99%) were higher than the percentages of female counterparts (59.87%, 49.00%) (both Ps < 0.05), but no obvious gender differences existed in recognizing health risks of heatwaves and infectious diseases as well as sensitive population identification (all Ps > 0.05). Most of the participants (92.50%) received climate change and health-related information from mass media like TV, radio, and newspapers. Meanwhile less men chose new media channels than women (OR=0.62, 95%C/: 0.41-0.94). Only 30.56% of the participants (33.69% of men and 28.60% of women) reported involvement of relevant training and lectures. Most of them (90.96%) agreed to take active measures to deal with the health threats associated with climate change without gender differences for various measures (all Ps > 0.05). The leading obstacles were hard to integrate health adaptation to climate change into main work of institutions (most female agreed, 72.28%) and the lack of funds (most male agreed, 77.66%). Increasing funding for primary health care was regarded as the most needed resource by male (86.88%) and female (89.14%). After controlling the influence of other social factors, more men agreed with the lack of funds than women (OR=1.57, 95%C/: 1.10-2.24). [Conclusion] There are some gender differences in the perceptions of health risks and adaptation strategies of climate change among primary healthcare workers: Male staff are more likely to agree with climate change and regard the lack of funds as the main obstacle, while women prefer to choose new media channels to obtain information. It's suggested that the government and relevant institutions focus on the learning and training of climate change and health-related knowledge and expand diversified information access, and promote capacity building to cope with health threats at grass-root level, in the light of recognized gender differences among primary healthcare workers. © 2022, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

We synthesize this literature using a vulnerability analysis approach that situates vulnerability and adaptive capacity within the context of the wider climate risk framework denoted in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. In doing so, we identify gendered barriers and enablers to private sector adaptation and suggest women entrepreneurs face a “triple differential vulnerability” to climate change, wherein they: (1) are often more sensitive to climate risk, as a result of their concentration in certain sectors and types of enterprises (e.g., micro SMEs in the agricultural sector in remote regions); (2) face additional barriers to adaptation in the business environment, including access to finance, technologies, (climate and adaptation) information and supportive policies; and (3) are also often concurrently on the frontline of managing climate risk at household levels. Since various forms of inequality often create compounding experiences of discrimination and vulnerability, we pay particular attention to how factors of differential vulnerability intersect, amplify, and reproduce.

Cisterns promote farmers’ ability to adapt to climatic stresses in the long run. This article discusses the impacts of the Rainwater Harvesting Program (RHP) on the livelihoods of women in BSA regions. The policy implementation is assessed in terms of capacity building, social mobilization, and the construction of infrastructure that guarantees rainwater harvesting for human consumption and productive uses. Based on semistructured interviews in case studies in Paraíba, Pernambuco and Ceará States, this article discusses how the gender perspective can improve adaptive capacity. The results from the case studies indicate important changes in female autonomy and increased independence related to water access, resulting in extra time for women to dedicate to other activities, including education. Moreover, the availability of water for production strengthened productive capacity, leading to greater food security and well-being. Last, a sense of economic independence related to income generation from improved production capacity was also reported. © 2022 Hipatia Editorial. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Gender-specific perceptions and needs are critical to better understanding climate change adaptation capacities of local smallholder communities in Africa and elsewhere. As many rural agricultural practices are heavily impacted by male-centered traditional customs and mores, gender dimensions can determine the level of success for policy interventions. To better understand how and what gender dimensions can be important factors for farmer’s climate change adaptations, this study attempts to examine smallholder farmers’ adaptation needs and perspectives in Ghana’s Upper East Region. A focus group discussion and a questionnaire survey were conducted among 200 smallholder farmers. We found that the female respondents, who mostly belonged to low/middle-income groups, emphasized their urgent need for financial support to improve their income. They needed more farmland as 94% of them had only less than 5 acres to farm. In addition, 91% of the female respondents expressed the importance of being connected to farmers’ mutual-help groups to share information about common farming needs. We also found gender-specific needs for extension services, farm inputs, climate information, mechanization, and infrastructure. Regarding access to resources, the women respondents had little interest in investing more in farming as the land they borrowed could be taken away by male owners. The study recommends the need for gender-specific support initiatives that prioritize social protection and gender equality. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Traditional studies have predominantly focused on assessing the vulnerability of agricultural communities to climate change impacts, neglecting the examination of their resilience in relation to gender, social status, and ethnicity. This study aims to fill these gaps by employing the Livelihood Subjective Resilience (LSR) framework to measure household resilience and conducting a comprehensive analysis of the intersectionality across these dimensions. The research focuses on a sample of 188 ethnic minority households (94 Tà Ôi and 94 Pa Cô) in upland regions of Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Findings reveal significant variations in resilience among these groups, particularly with lower LSR scores observed among women and the poor. Notably, poor women from Pa Cô ethnic households exhibit the most fragile resilience compared to other segments of society. This disparity is influenced by multifaceted ingredients including limited financial resources, restricted asset portfolios, patriarchal social norms, and psychological issues. The study thus emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance the roles and rights of marginalized groups, particularly in terms of equitable access to resources like land tenure. Addressing poverty and inequality should be the most priority for achieving economic rural development, disaster preparedness, and resilience capacity building. The study highlights the importance of tailored training programs and non-refundable livelihood support to improve overall well-being and uplift disadvantaged groups. By combining these initiatives, a more inclusive approach to climate change resilience can be fostered, ensuring that no one is left behind. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rural women’s contribution to reacting to climate change is highly significant but has been largely marginalized due to gender roles. This gender discrimination makes them more vulnerable to a variety of threats. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the behaviour of female rice farmers in Mazandaran Province, in northern Iran, toward climate change adaptation using protection motivation theory (PMT). 173 female heads of households’ rice farmers in Mazandaran Province were selected through stratified random sampling. According to the findings, the perceived vulnerability (β = 0.19), perceived severity (β = 0.33), self-efficacy (β = 0.4), and response effectiveness (β = 0.35) of female rice farmers have a positive and noticeable effect on responding behaviour to climate change. However, the response costs (β = −0.61) have a negative but noticeable effect on their adaptation behaviour toward changing climate. Research findings also show that climate change severely damages the physical capital of women paddy farmers. The damage caused by these climate crises has a greater impact on the production capacity, product quality, production costs and food security of female heads of households. The findings of this study will help define patterns determining the adaptation of women to climate change, and public and private sector’s strategic planning and action. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study documented adaptation strategies employed by rural women in Vhembe district as they reel with climate change impacts. Women are heavily plagued by climate change impacts than any other genders worldwide. This is attributed to their high dependence on the natural resources for survival, low adaptive capacity, illiteracy, social ascribed roles that limit their participation in climate change initiatives like men and high poverty levels. Despite the daunting fact of women's vulnerability to climate change and its vagary impacts, women are agents of social change who have not remained passive victims to climate change and its impacts. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative methodology guided by multi-case study design. A sample of 25 participants was selected through simple random and purposive sampling techniques. Data were collected using Focus Group Discussions and individual interviews and analysed thematically. Rural women and traditional leaders served as key informants and participated in the study. Findings: The study established that the effects of climate change on rural women are real; however, there is a cocktail of strategies employed by women in Vhembe district in response to these effects. The strategies include livelihood and crop diversification, use of indigenous knowledge systems and harnessing of social capital among other household-based adaptation strategies. Originality/value: The study recommends that the best way of assisting rural women in adapting to climate change is through the amelioration of poverty, enhancing capacity building for women and elimination of all systems that serve as barriers to effective adaptation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

They have looked to worlds outside the modern system to lead us out of current unjust practices harming both humans and the environment. Although policymaking may be seen as the stronghold of the current political agenda and of the structures that have led to the climate crisis, we argue that climate policies too, are also crucial for rethinking and transforming societies. Our examination of climate adaptation policies in Sweden and the literature from Europe shows how policy documents ignore and unknow the oppressive intersections of gender and power despite the knowledge that exists on these issues in the public domain. Drawing on the tools of agnotology, we examine how this is achieved by strategies of ‘denial, dismissal, diversion and displacement.’ Building on feminist post and decolonial scholarship, we make explicit the gendered and racial hierarchies and dichotomies underpinning these policy documents. At the same time, we bring attention to the nuances in the policy documents we study and look for the openings that might be used to bring about transformation by making these hierarchies explicit and calling them into question. We argue that a transformation is possible through a feminist post and decolonial intervention, even in policymaking otherwise ignorant of culture, values and the colonial histories that have produced contemporary society. © 2023 The Authors},

However, as with any other developmental approach, the WELF nexus needs to mainstream gender, which often lies at the heart of poverty, unemployment, and inequality in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to water, energy, land and food is gendered, and so are livelihood strategies and climate change responses. Inequitable access to these resources, gender inequalities, socio-economic vulnerability and cultural norms contribute to women's susceptibility to the impacts of climate change and limit their ability to harness opportunities arising from it. Reducing women's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change in SSA and improving equity in natural resource access and resource use efficiencies will require transformation of gender relations and the active participation of both men and women in decision-making processes. Moreover, policies and interventions that cater to the WELF nexus need be updated to be more gender-aware and sensitive, as this will also contribute to addressing Sustainable Development Goal 5, in addition to Goals 1, 2, 6, 7, and 15.

	abstract = {Background: The expected increase in heat in The Gambia is one of the most significant health threats caused by climate change. However, little is known about the gendered dynamics of exposure and response to heat stress, including women's perceived health risks, their adaptation strategies to heat, and their perceptions of climate change. This research project aims to answer the question of whether and how pregnant farmers in The Gambia perceive and act upon occupational heat stress and its health impacts on both themselves and their unborn children, against the backdrop of current and expected climatic changes. Method: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women who practice subsistence farming and were either pregnant or had delivered within the past month in West Kiang, The Gambia. Participants were selected using purposive sampling. Translated interview transcripts were coded and qualitative thematic content analysis with an intersectional lens was used to arrive at the results. Results: All women who participated in the study experience significant heat stress while working outdoors during pregnancy, with symptoms often including headache, dizziness, nausea, and chills. The most common adaptive techniques included resting in the shade while working, completing their work in multiple shorter time increments, taking medicine to reduce symptoms like headache, using water to cool down, and reducing the amount of area they cultivate. Layered identities, experiences, and household power structures related to age, migration, marital situation, socioeconomic status, and supportive social relationships shaped the extent to which women were able to prevent and reduce the effects of heat exposure during their work whilst pregnant. Women who participated in this study demonstrated high awareness of climate change and offered important insights into potential values, priorities, and mechanisms to enable effective adaptation. Conclusion: Our findings reveal many intersecting social and economic factors that shape the space within which women can make decisions and take adaptive action to reduce the impact of heat during their pregnancy. To improve the health of pregnant working women exposed to heat, these intersectionalities must be considered when supporting women to adapt their working practices and cope with heat stress.

Within the disadvantaged groups adversely affected by climate risks, women are disproportionately exposed, have higher levels of vulnerability and typically suffer the impacts because of cultural norms and their reproductive and productive roles. Although women play an important role in their family and community, they are generally ignored in climate change planning. This paper examines floods and flood-related impacts on urban women in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to demonstrate how women are vulnerable, as well as their responses and resilience to shocks and stress caused by current flood risks within their communities. Data were collected through in-depth case studies applying qualitative methods (observation and semi-structured interviews). The results illustrate that women are less resilient as they have less access to resources and limited support for incremental livelihood improvement. The opportunities to participate in adaptation planning are limited for women. The findings demonstrate that gender inequality still remains, although women could play an active and critical role in adaptation programmes. In order to enhance women’s resilience to climatic hazards, the paper argues that urban policy planning should empower women too in the decision-making process and promote diversified resources to strengthen their resilience to climatic hazards. © 2023 National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).},

	abstract = {In contrast to the dominant ‘vulnerability narrative’ applied to studies of gender, age, and other intersectional characteristics in determining differentiated impacts of climate change, there is growing attention to the agency and voices of young people in the context of their development futures in a changing climate. This paper draws on Feminist Participatory Action Research undertaken by adolescent girls in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Centred on access to education, the findings prompt a reframing of youth agency and empowerment beyond instrumental concerns to integrate intrinsic factors that include self-fulfilment, recognition from others, status, and self-resilience. The research demonstrates how young people’s enquiry can help to surface the underlying structures of inequality shaping both their gendered experience of climate change and the response options available. Tackling structural issues may be beyond the conventional scope of climate change projects and policy, but gender and youth concerns require more than incremental changes. Rather, harnessing opportunities from low-carbon and climate-resilient futures requires understanding and tackling structural drivers of gender inequality that influence development opportunities for young people. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Scholars of gender and climate change argue that gender-blind climate change actions could exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine sustained climate change adaptation actions. For this reason, since 2017, the Green Climate Fund placed gender among its key programming prerequisites, making it the first multilateral climate fund to do so worldwide. However, to date, no lessons to inform planned gender-responsive ecosystem-based interventions in Namibia have been drawn from community-based natural resource management. Thus, this paper aims to share key lessons regarding the way in which gender assessment is useful in enhancing equity in an eco-system-based adaptation programme for the Green Climate Fund. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews and group discussions in the 14 rural regions of Namibia with 151 participants from 107 community-based natural resource management organisations (73.5:26.5; male:female ra-tio). The results identified gender imbalances in leadership and decision-making due to intersecting historic inequalities, ethnicity and geography, as well as other socio-cultural factors in local com-munity-based natural resource management institutions. We also identified income disparities and unequal opportunities to diversify livelihoods, gendered differentiated impacts of climate change and meaningful participation in public forums. Overall, the assessment indicates that considering gender analysis at the initiation of a community-based climate change adaptation project is crucial for achieving resilience to climate change, closing the gender gap, building capacity to increase equity and empowering women in resource-dependent environments in Namibia and Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the social discourses of climate change, women are perceived both as vulnerable victims and as active players in adaptation. These perceptions of women along with inclusion policies have led climate change adaptation programs to seek women’s participation. However, ‘women’ is not a homogenous category. Intra-gender power differences in terms of castes and ethnicities can play an important role, especially in Nepal with its long history of institutionalized disparities. Using qualitative methodology, this study explores the relationships between gender, caste and ethnicity in shaping women’s participation in climate change adaptation programs in the southern plains of Nepal. We conclude that women’s gender identities generally facilitated their participation and that affirmative action for marginalized groups, to some extent, gave women from these groups spaces to participate in climate change adaptation programs. However, power relations associated with caste/ethnic identity created hindrances for marginalized women, implying that they had more restricted access than women from the majority groups. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Climate change poses a significant threat to various sectors, including agriculture, affecting men and women unevenly. Although gender-based perceptions of climate change have been studied, there remains a gap in understanding how these perceptions influence the adoption of adaptation strategies among men and women smallholder farmers in the production of leguminous crops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated the gender differences in the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among bean and cowpea farmers in Ghana. The findings revealed that socioeconomic and institutional factors significantly influenced the choice of adaptation strategies, with notable differences between men and women. Higher levels of education, farming experience, marital status, access to credit, and education determined the choice of adaptation strategies. On the other hand, women farmers, despite having lower levels of formal education, showed a higher utilization of extension services, possibly due to targeted efforts to reach out to more women farmers. Larger households were less likely to adopt mixed cropping and changing cropping patterns, while married individuals were less likely to use crop rotation. Training and access to credit significantly increased the likelihood of adopting crop rotation, changing cropping patterns, and using improved seeds. The study also found that [f]armers perceptions of the impacts of dry spells and delayed onset of rains influenced the use of climate change adaptation strategies. Furthermore, farmers who participated in climate change planning were more likely to use diverse adaptation strategies, underscoring the importance of a locally focused, inclusive planning process. However, gender differences were observed in the determinants of the use of these strategies. For instance, while access to extension services was found to be more influential for women, men’s decisions were more influenced by their marital status, access to credit, and education. Policy makers and local institutions need to encourage and facilitate farmers’ involvement in climate change planning processes to enable designing of effective, context-relevant, inclusive, and sustainable climate change adaptation strategies. Distinct differences in the factors underlying the use of adaptation strategies by men and women demand creation of and implementation of gender-sensitive programs that effectively reach and benefit both women and women.

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is mainly to investigate climate change adaptation practices and the applicability of a cultural sustainability approach in understanding gender dimension of the residents of the southwest coast of Bangladesh. It is one of the most vulnerable regions in South Asia due to the significant impacts of climate change. The long-term effects of climate change in this region are the increasing salinity in farmlands, heatwaves, and sea-level rise. The southwest coast of Bangladesh is a classic example of “good practice” as well as the center for learning, implementing, and communicating climate change adaptation actions in practice. The reason for this the collective action carried out to initiate and improve adaptation activities by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Government of Bangladesh, as well as several national and international development and non-government organizations (NGOs). Using a systematic review of literature, and field-based case studies, we examined how gender and cultural issues (such as the adaptive capacity of men and women, and the transformation of gendered power relations) have been addressed to successfully implement climate change adaptation initiatives in the context of the nominated study area. Our study results revealed that both male and female participants were strategic and capable of dealing with climate change impacts, although the adaptive capacity of the former group was comparatively sturdier than the later. The extent of cultural sustainability was found to be weaker in the study region compared to many other coastal communities in the country. The efforts made by NGOs in collaboration with the governmental bodies of Bangladesh were found contributory in providing knowledge of climate change along with the techniques to adapt to its consequences for the people of the study region. Similarly, the activities of NGOs were found influential in helping the government to support people in adapting to climate change in terms of the gendered and cultural sustainability perspectives. Our findings contribute to the field of climate change impacts in understanding the complexities of rural development. Copyright © 2022 Roy, Tandukar and Bhattarai.},

	abstract = {Demak Regency is one of several cities that are submerged by tidal flooding disasters caused by climate change, especially in Sriwulan Village, Sayung District, which threatens the sustainable built environment and also the women in the village. Even though the built environment has been disturbed by climate change, women can adapt and take the initiative during disaster events, including taking the place of their jobless husbands as breadwinners during the Covid-19 pandemic. A gender-responsive village master plan could become a crucial issue in village development, especially for the ones impacted by disasters. Therefore, this research is located in Sriwulan village, Sayung District, Demak Regency which wants to create a gender eco-friendly master plan for Sriwulan village for a sustainable built environment. A descriptive-qualitative method was conducted to produce a gender eco-friendly Sriwulan village’s master plan. The result found a rapid increase in tidal flooding inundation and level in Sriwulan village. It was also reported that women have a limited role in tidal flooding disaster risk reduction and adaptation because of insufficient information, training, and workshop about climate change, disaster risk reduction, and adaptation. In conclusion, women should be given the opportunity as an actor in leading the community to cope with the climate change impact for a better future by increasing their capability and fair knowledge. In the future, village life will be prolonged by the “Gender Eco-Friendly Master Plan for Sustainable Built Environment of Sriwulan Village” which will change Sriwulan to a prospective Eco-Tourism Village. © 2023 by authors.

This paper examines gender differences in on-farm and off-farm climate adaptation measures undertaken by smallholder coffee farmers in Western Honduras. We conducted 29 qualitative interviews with women and men coffee farmers in three coffee-dependent villages in Intibucá. We find that participants, regardless of gender, use few on-farm climate adaptation measures, and increasingly rely on off-farm activities such as waged employment and international migration to complement their coffee-based livelihoods. We also find that women farmers utilize fewer adaptation measures due to a gender asset gap and the gender division of labor in coffee-producing households. We conclude that women's limited access to the means of production in coffee-producing communities and their responsibilities for domestic labor impede community resilience to climate change. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change has garnered widespread societal concern due to its yawning consequences on both the natural environment and human society. Consequently, the imperative for adaptation to climate change has become intensely entrenched in the collective psyche of humanity. Traditionally, women have played an indispensable role in climate adaptation processes, yet their invaluable contributions remain unfortunately disregarded and underrepresented. While contemporary financial assistance promotes women’s engagement in climate change adaptation, the coping strategies in real situations are widely varied and are significantly important to discuss. This study endeavors to rectify this gap by identifying and revealing the adaptive strategies of women in response to the vulnerabilities engendered by the multidimensional impacts of climate change. Thus, this study was conducted deploying a mixed research methodology combined with qualitative and quantitative approaches, particularly focus group discussions (FGD), household surveys, and key informant interviews (KII) across three villages in the Nilphamari district of Northwestern Bangladesh. The findings of this study reveal that women have made substantial contributions to adapting to the impacts of climate change through the execution of distinctive saving mechanisms. In facing adversities resulting from climate-induced losses, women exhibit a commendable capacity for adaptation by leveraging their accrued financial reserves as a robust and astute coping mechanism. This study suggests a broader replication of this approach to confront the impacts of climate change. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change has forced the world into a state of emergency, but the urgency can also become an oppor¬tunity to strengthen the focus on sustainable development and reduce social vulnerability. For developing economies, the first and foremost challenge regarding climate change is to address the knowledge gap on sustainable development and vul¬nerability. Besides this, evidence-based inputs are needed for the policies and programs that intend to enhance the adaptive capacity and social capital from the gender perspective in comparatively more disaster-prone districts of the country. The environmental impact in terms of socioeconomic conditions specifically pertaining to rural areas of Pakistan cannot be ig¬nored. Natural events such as floods and droughts have raised the question of the social and socioeconomic vulnerability of the rural communities. This paper is an attempt toward understanding that everyone who is affected will be impacted differ¬ently by climate change both within the same gender and between different genders, including gender minorities. in addition, an attempt is made to identify the drivers of gender-disaggregated social vulnerability in selected disaster-prone rural commu¬nities of the district of Dadu, Sindh Province, Pakistan. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques are employed to examine the differences in gender perception on climate change, experiences related to climate change, disasters, and impacts on their lives. Women and households headed by them are found to be relatively more vulnerable due to their socioeconomic and social status in the rural areas of Pakistan. The paper gives policy directives that not only address the measures for reduction in climate change impacts but also suggest the development of effective disaster management programs, policies, and strategies. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The Himalayan region has a long history of managing agrobiodiversity as a source of livelihood, a practice that has withstood multiple forms of climatic, social and ecological risks. In the recent decades of agricultural modernization, research and development projects have sought to improve productivity of agriculture focusing on high-yielding varieties and other modes of technical efficiencies, while agricultural landscapes are undergoing rapid transformation such as rural to urban migration. In such context, there is a dilemma as to how agricultural development can be adapted to tackle climatic and socio-economic drivers, in a way that can lead to gender equality and social justice. Combining social-ecological systems approach with feminist political ecology lenses, this chapter examines the interplay between gender equity and adaptation in the Nepal Himalayas. A case study of farm-level practices with a focus on rice cultivation in a mountain village in Nepal shows how gender roles and relations are influenced by wider socio-economic changes and discusses how gender roles shape adaptation practices as households adopt high-yielding low land rice variety and abandon upland rice cultivation. The chapter concludes that agricultural modernization has not only exacerbated gender inequality but also made the farming communities more vulnerable to climate change. It is argued that a more holistic approach to agricultural research and development is needed, with full appreciation of gender-based differentiations in knowledge, management and policy, so that agriculture can withstand the impact of climate change and the socio-economic changes that the Himalayan region is undergoing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {The contextual and risk perception about climate change and its consequences could help individuals respond appropriately and make timely adaptation actions. The level of perception or knowledge on climate change issues is often gender-sensitive, and it is usually less among vulnerable women. To this end, this study investigates different dimensions of risk perceptions on climate change among the ultra-poor women group within the high flood areas of Bangladesh. The study has used an empirical approach to collect primary and secondary data using both qualitative and quantitative research tools at the same time. According to the findings of the study, individual perceptions of climate change among women are relatively low. Nonetheless, they have observed significant changes in a variety of climatic variables over the last three decades. Furthermore, this study identified some major adaptation options, such as plinth raising, livestock rearing, homestead gardening, seasonal migration, and using indigenous knowledge, among others, to address the adverse effects of climate change-induced extreme events, such as flooding, at the local level. Respondents spent significant amounts of money from individual sources in the study area to implement these adaptation measures. A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is also used to comprehend any links between climate change understandings and other variables connected with the studied community. The SEM findings indicated that climate change would be a long-term challenge, and it is a strong predictor in this model, with standardized regression weight β = 0.56. Despite the respondent’s lack of knowledge about climate change, it means that climate change is occurring and has become the most significant factor limiting cultural, economic, and environmental development in the study area. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Adopting a qualitative approach, this study performs a gender analysis of the climate change effects on rice farmers’ adaptation strategies (AS) in Mazandaran Province (northern Iran) based on the sustainable livelihood approach. For this purpose, 36 male and female heads of households in Arab Mahalla and Qajar Khel villages and 10 heads of households in Kiasar village (in Mazandaran Province) were selected and studied through theoretical and purposeful sampling methods of Corbin and Strauss. These villages have the highest number of female household heads and have been severely affected by the climate crisis in recent years. For the male-headed households (n = 23), the most important climate crisis was drought (f=16), and for the female-headed households (n = 23), drought, cold, and early off-season frost and monsoon storms were the most important (f=13). The results also indicated that in climatic crises, human (X̅=12.35) and social (X̅=13) capital from the women's perspective and financial (X̅=12.5) and physical (X̅=13) capital from the men's perspective had the highest vulnerability percentages whereas natural capital was equally affected from both the men's and women's viewpoints. One of the innovative aspects of this study is the gender analysis of the impact of climate change on the AS of sustainable livelihood framework based on a qualitative approach. This study recommends that beyond increasing the diversity of living amid climate change, deliberate climate change efforts should be directed at women and that fundamental gender discrimination such as prejudices and gender inequality should be eliminated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The region is also the home of the youth, the future of the globe, but their life is often exposed to stressors that are linked to environmental, particularly climatic, disasters. Besides looking after their personal needs, the role of women is usually to take care of the children, elderly and indisposed people who due to their incapacities become the major victims of extreme climatic events. This paper is an attempt to review the gendered perceptions in climate sensitivity and resilience, whereby the authors have tried to propose a women-centric climatic hazard management. The analysis is done on the basis of reviewing both government and nongovernmental reports and primary data captured on various aspects of the focal theme through a structured online poll using Web 2.0 platforms, mainly to understand women’s role in climatic hazard management. Largely, it has been found that women are not as vulnerable as they may seem and are also willing to come forward to lead climate change mitigation challenges from the front. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Climate change is adversely affecting food production systems while increasing the vulnerability of human societies-especially resource-poor small producers-and diminishing their resilience to food and nutrition insecurity. Even with a 1.5 °C scenario, climate change is believed to leave disadvantaged populations weakly resilient to food, health, and livelihood insecurity. Additionally, the scale of change required to limit warming to 1.5 °C is historically unprecedented and can only be achieved through strategically important societal transformation and ambitious mitigation measures, a requirement still not efficiently met by the majority of countries, especially key carbon emitters. This chapter accordingly aims at analyzing the dynamics through which climate change affects food and nutrition insecurity and drawing the pathways towards resilience building in this area. The analysis starts with investigating the predominant impacts of climate change on food security and resilience; then assesses these dynamics from international and regional perspectives; and finally explores some best pathways and approaches toward building resilience for food and nutrition security in a changing climate. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Climate change impacts are distributed unequally, despite affecting the entire world and its inhabitants. Economically, socially and culturally deprived groups are more vulnerable to climate change impacts. Women comprise the majority among these vulnerable groups, and it is, therefore, crucial to stress gendered perspectives in climate change adaptation strategies that promote gender equality and sustainable development. To that end, this paper documents the adaptation strategies employed by farmers and examines gender differences in climate change adaptation practices in Yunnan Province, China. A random sampling technique was used to select 1520 household heads for the survey. We used descriptive statistics and a multivariate probit model to document four categories of adaptation measures against a set of household features, social network, financial assets and perception variables. We discovered that female and male respondents do not significantly differ in their knowledge and perceptions of climate change, but female- and male-headed household respondents did differ in adopting climate change adaptation measures. The adaptation measures of female- and male-headed households were influenced by different sets of factors. The most significant determinant for both female- and male-headed households was perception of drought events in the last 20 years, followed by access to loans, while income from non-farm-based work had positive and significant impacts only for male-headed households. Findings from this study will help to elucidate the determinants of climate change adaptation decisions for female- and male-headed households in farming communities and the strategic interventions necessary for effective adaptation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

While focusing on the effect of climate shocks on rural areas in general and the farming sector in particular, the study is organised around three main themes: (i) agricultural labor market vulnerability, (ii) gender-specific effects, and (iii) adaptation mechanisms. Evidence suggests that women face unique challenges in disaster recovery due to their role as caregivers, unequal access to resources, labor market discrimination and cultural restrictions. The response of household labor supply to climatic stress is different in the short-run and the long-run. While the long-term strategy is contingent on their ability to diversify into non-farm livelihood alternatives and migration to distant places, rural households cope with climate shocks in the short run by relying on affirmative government actions, remittance income and participating in agricultural wage labor. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

These industries may also increase participation by women as compared to wild-caught fisheries that have been traditionally male-dominated. Here we ask whether transitions to shellfish and seaweed (or non-fed) aquaculture increase gender equity in Maine's fisheries, where the lobster fishery has been dominant for three decades. We find that non-fed aquaculture has increased women's participation by more than four times; 23.1 % of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture license holders are female, compared to 4.8 % of lobster license holders. Women's participation is highest (37.8 %) within the fast-growing, but relatively low-value seaweed aquaculture sector and lowest (17.6 %) in higher-value oyster farming. Women hold half of the Limited Purpose Aquaculture licenses (a subclass of licenses intended to simplify the process of entering into aquaculture) for seaweed, suggesting that they function to increase women's participation. Women in these industries attribute differential female participation in non-fed aquaculture as compared to lobster fisheries to fewer gendered institutional barriers, an ability to achieve more independence in marketing and distribution, and more flexible working hours. Exclusionary institutions are still seen as barriers to success in non-fed aquaculture, but female farmers also report that they have created informal leadership roles focused on community building and social responsibility. Together these results suggest that transitions to non-fed aquaculture have the potential to increase gender equity in this sector of seafood production, but further reducing gendered institutions is key to achieving this outcome. © 2022},

	abstract = {Households’ food security in semi-arid Ghana is under pressure due to water scarcity and climate variability. Climate variability has become the biggest setback to livelihoods and wellbeing in this area, where high dependence on rainfed agriculture coexists with fragile ecosystems. However, the household vulnerability to water scarcity is not only determinate by environmental challenges. Climatic challenges correlate with social, economic, cultural and political inequalities. These factors determine the adaptive responses to water scarcity of different social groups. Focusing on the case study dedicated to the groundnut farmers in semi-arid Ghana, this paper aims at defining the vulnerability determinants to water scarcity and at assessing capacities to adapt to water crises considering the social components (age, gender, education, land ownership). The results show that the reasons for non-adoption and increased vulnerability are directly influenced by social and demographic factors such as age, gender and land ownership. We conclude that to assess the vulnerability and develop successful adaptation strategies, it is critical to identify and articulate not just the climatic drivers, but also the social, economic and political conditions. The socio-economic and political factors contribute to both, to intensifying the vulnerability and to shaping the ability to adapt to changing climatic conditions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {This study examines whether agroecological farming practices, when employed by highly vulnerable households in sub-Saharan Africa, can improve food security and dietary diversity. The research involved a four-year study with 425 smallholder households, selected purposively based on high levels of food insecurity and/or positive HIV status. The households carried out agroecological experiments of their own choosing over a four-year period. Baseline (n = 306) and follow-up (n = 352) surveys were conducted in 2011 and 2013 respectively to assess changes in farming practices, food security, crop diversity and dietary diversity. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used with 203 matched households to estimate determinants of change in food security and dietary diversity at the population level. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were also conducted to provide depth to the survey findings. The findings show that participatory agroecology experimentation increased intercropping, legume diversification and the addition of compost, manure and crop residue amendments to the soil. Intercropping was associated with food security and the use of organic soil amendments was associated with gains in dietary diversity in bivariate analysis. Household food security and dietary diversity increased significantly over a 2-year period. Importantly, multivariate models showed that spousal discussion about farming was strongly associated with increased household food security and dietary diversity. Households who discussed farming with their spouse were 2.4 times more likely to be food secure and have diverse diets. Addition of compost or manure to the soil significantly influenced dietary diversity. These findings indicate that poor, vulnerable farmers can use agroecological methods to effectively improve food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. The study also highlights how linking agroecology to participatory research approaches that promote farmer experimentation and gender equity also lead to greater health and well-being. The study sheds light on how agroecological approaches can rapidly improve food security and dietary diversity, even under conditions of acute social, health or ecological stress. It draws attention to issues of equity and farmer-led approaches in addressing food security and nutrition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The empirical data showed similarities in climate change perceptions between men and women, and rising temperatures, shortened cropping season, and increasing erratic rainfall as the main climatic stressors. Lack of money and inadequate access to labor among women and inadequate access to extension and old age/poor health among men were the major constraints to mitigating climate change impacts.

The opportunity for transformative change, however, risks being lost when representations of disaster increasingly obscure and silence the full costs and complexity of post-disaster recovery. This article identifies the construction and subsequent proliferation of survival myths in the context of the Philippines after the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan disaster from a feminist perspective. Using data from in-depth interviews and surveys, we examine the experiences of middle and lower-class households in three heavily affected communities in Tacloban City to challenge three dominant survival myths: the local culture of mutual assistance (bayanihan), the endless resourcefulness of Filipinos in times of crisis, and the positive contributions of overseas migrant remittances. We argue that these myths have served as tools for reinforcing gendered inequalities during and after the disaster because they render invisible the feminisation of care burdens, and contribute to gender gaps in ensuring accountability for post-disaster governance. The evidence from this research underscores the importance of interrogating how similar survival myths are being globalised in disaster governance at the expense of forging substantive gender equality in post-disaster settings. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Scholarly interest has shifted from gendered dynamics of climate change adaptation to the socio-political drivers of gendered inequalities that produce discriminatory opportunities for adaptation. This study utilises an intersectional subjectivities lens to examine how entrenched power dynamics and social norms related to gender, as well as age and marital status, galvanise or inhibit capacities to adapt in farming communities of Ghana’s Central Region. Through the use of interviews, focus group discussions, and photovoice sessions, we highlight gendered and intersectional subjectivities, roles, and responsibilities that centre on perceived differences in men’s and women’s strength and power. We then link resulting normative performances of gender to specific barriers to adaptation, such as lack of resources and agency, and demonstrate a pronounced dichotomy as women experience the brunt of these barriers and a persistent power imbalance that positions them as ‘less able’ to adapt than men. Such nuanced assessments of intersectional subjectivities are instrumental in supporting marginalised groups when deliberating and renegotiating inequitable power relations in climate change adaptation. Through repeated efforts at power subversion, emboldened social actors and critical scholars attuned to navigating power differentials can strengthen adaptive capacities and facilitate trajectories toward transformation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This paper presents empirical data from nine communities across three islands in Vanuatu that experienced a direct hit from category 5 tropical cyclone Pam in 2015. The research compared the actions taken by communities that had engaged in a mid- to long-term DRR program with those that had not. The DRR program prioritised disability inclusion and women’s participation in, and leadership of, the community. Early warnings were widely heard across all communities but the communities that had engaged with the DRR program had greater understanding of, and trust in, the early warnings. They took earlier and more coordinated action and were safer during the cyclone. Compared with their past experiences, there was increased respect for women’s voices and roles, women and men collaborated more, and people with disability were supported by the whole community. The research concludes that tropical cyclone early warnings are necessary but not sufficient to ensure there is community and household preparation. There is a strong case for investments in mid- to long-term DRR focused on community and household capacity, prioritising women’s active and equal participation as community leaders, and disability inclusion. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study analyses climate change vulnerability and adaptation in a northern province in Vietnam from the gender perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was used to collect data for the study. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) was calculated for 134 female and 239 male-headed households. Descriptive statistics were synthesized to investigate climate change adaptation from the gender perspective. Findings: The results show that the LVI of female-headed households is higher than male-headed households, but the variation is negligible. In addition, female and male farmers in the study area use different methods to adapt to climate change. Female farmers have critically contributed to the family workforce and climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, female farmers have less accessibility to agricultural services such as training and credit. Research limitations/implications: The study suggests that gendered interventions for improvement of livelihood to adapt to climate change should be developed for each aspect of the livelihood. Furthermore, enhancement of services for women and recognition of women's roles in responding to climate change would contribute to more active adaptation to climate change. Originality/value: Studies on climate change from the gender perspective in Vietnam have been conducted on a limited scale. Particularly, there are very limited studies on climate change in association with gender issue in North Vietnam. Thus, this study will provide more insights into the gender dimension of climate change vulnerability and adaptation so that gender-based adaptation strategies can be developed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Economic and environmental interventions in the Anthropocene have created disruptions that are threatening the capacity of socio-ecological systems to recover from adversities and to be able to maintain key functions for preserving resilience. The authors of this paper underscore the benefits of a workshop-based methodology for developing a vision and an approach to the inner processes of creation that can be used to increase resilience, to cope with societal vulnerabilities and to develop the tools for future planning at local, regional and global scales. Diverse areas of discourse ranging from climate science and sustainability, to psychoanalysis, linguistics and eco-philosophy, contributed meaningfully to the transdisciplinary approach for enhancing resilience. A framework is proposed that can be used throughout society, that integrates the importance of human subjectivity and the variability of human contexts, especially gender, in shaping human experiences and responses to climate change impacts and challenges such as the covid-19 pandemic. Within the domain of socio-economic research, the authors challenge researchers and policy makers to expand future perspectives of resilience through the proposed systemic resilience vision. Movement towards transformative thinking and actions requires inner exploration and visualization of desirable futures for integrating ecological, social, cultural, ethical, and economic dimensions as agencies for catalyzing the transition to livable, sustainable, equitable, ethical, and resilient societies. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Climate change poses as one of the greatest ethical challenges of the contemporary era and which is rapidly affecting all sectors and ecosystems, including natural ecosystems and human and social environments. The impacts on human societies, and societies’ ability to mitigate and adapt to these changes and to adhere to ethical principles are influenced by various factors, including gender. Therefore, this study aimed to design a model of climate change adaptation behavior among rice farmers in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, based on gender analysis (IUCN, UNDP and GGCA in Training manual on gender and climate change, 2009) and using the developed model of protection motivation theory (Bockarjova and Steg in Glob Environ Change 28:276–288, 2014). For this purpose, 173 female and 233 male rice farmers in Mazandaran Province were selected through stratified random sampling. The results showed that threat and coping appraisal had positive and significant effects on climate change adaptation behavior in both groups. Additionally, men’s and women’s perceived severity had the greatest impact on threat appraisal, and response costs had the greatest impact on their coping appraisal of climate change. Given that climate change adaptation behavior has been largely dependent on the development of ethical principles and the behavior of men and women toward climate change and based on the research findings, some suggestions are recommended at the mega (international), macro (governmental and legislative), meso (related organizations) and micro (rice farmers) levels for male and female rice farmers to adapt to the climate change phenomenon. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

However, the challenge is to derive lessons from micro analysis of differential vulnerabilities caused by unequal power relations among different gender groups belonging to various social strata and take it to a broader policy level. Based on gender analysis of vulnerable populations living in different stretches of Gandaki river basin in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, this paper presents issues on gendered vulnerabilities and suggests possible adaptation measures. Evidence based on a participatory assessment of socioeconomic drivers and conditions leading to vulnerabilities and gender analysis of 107 Focus Group Discussions with homogenous groups of women and men belonging to various vulnerable social groups at up, mid and downstream of the basin form primary data source. The analysis concludes that there are changes in gender space, i.e. roles, responsibilities and domains to cope stressors. These include an increasing trend of women's presence in the local market and men's involvement in distant markets, both as labourers or small entrepreneurs. However, there are insufficient corresponding institutional and policy responses on social security and protection measures to address these changes. As a result, extreme of vulnerabilities such as violence against women and children have increased. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Rural communities in Pacific small island states, which rely directly and acutely on the benefits from ecosystem services, face a range of interlinking threats to their management of natural resources, exacerbated by climate change-related risks, all against the backdrop of rapid social and economic transition. Appropriate and sufficient community adaptation responses are required to maintain habitats and sustain livelihoods. Adaptation responses are mediated through often competing subjective discourses. We used Q-method to reveal discourses within a subsistence community in Vanuatu and amongst associated stakeholders. We revealed three discourses, which we called Strong Kastom, Kastom + Health and Tentative Modernity. When we compared stakeholder socio-demographic attributes we found a statistically significant gender difference between membership of Strong Kastom, which was skewed towards men and Tentative Modernity, which was skewed towards women. We also found that external practitioners were weighted away from Tentative Modernity. Our results suggest ecosystem-based adaptations to climate change will likely resonate with the community if they support customary natural resource knowledge and management, and provide opportunities for generating income, and promoting gender equity in decision-making. Our results also suggest external practitioners may not consider income generation to be sufficiently important to community resilience. © 2020},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to exacerbate existing food security challenges, especially in Indigenous communities worldwide. Community-based monitoring (CBM) is considered a promising strategy to improve monitoring of, and local adaptation to climatic and environmental change. Yet, it is unclear how this approach can be applied in food security or Indigenous contexts. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) review and synthesize the published literature on CBM of Indigenous food security; and, (2) identify gaps and trends in these monitoring efforts in the context of climate change. Using a systematic search and screening process, we identified 86 published articles. To be included, articles had to be published in a journal, describe a CBM system, describe any aspect of food security, and explicitly mention an Indigenous community. Relevant articles were thematically analyzed to characterize elements of CBM in the context of climate change. Results show that the number of articles published over time was steady and increased more than two-fold within the last five years. The reviewed articles reported on monitoring mainly in North America (37%) and South America (28%). In general, monitoring was either collaborative (51%) or externally-driven (37%), and focused primarily on tracking wildlife (29%), followed by natural resources (16%), environmental change (15%), fisheries (13%), climate change (9%), or some combination of these topics (18%). This review provides an evidence-base on the uses, characteristics, and opportunities of CBM, to guide future food security monitoring efforts in the context of climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper identifies the major climate shocks affecting maize-legume farmers in Kenya, and the factors associated with their decision to adapt including the specific adaptation strategies to employ. During 2000–2010 surveyed farm households reported drought, crop pests and excessive rainfall as the most frequent and severe climate shocks. Probit regression results show that previous experiences of drought reduce the likelihood of adaptation to drought and excessive rainfall. Female-headed households are more inclined than male-headed households to adapt to excessive rainfall. Next, multivariate probit regression results identify farm adjustment (e.g. use of improved varieties and replanting) to be a substitution strategy for selling assets and borrowing for drought adaptation, while reducing consumption seems to be a complementary strategy for borrowing. To adapt to crop pests, farm adjustment seems to be a substitution strategy for selling assets and reducing consumption; however, selling assets is a complementary strategy for borrowing. Policy to encourage adaptation should incorporate implication of multiple shocks and target assistance to poor, food-insecure and female-headed households as these are often disadvantaged in terms of asset endowment and access to the technology necessary for adaptation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background. Though many studies have long considered the broad social implications of climate change, researchers have only recently started to consider the gendered unevenness of the global landscape of vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity to environmental stressors and shocks. Historically, policies and interventions addressing natural resource-based livelihoods have rarely considered underlying gender dynamics despite the global pervasiveness of gendered disparities in both economic opportunities and welfare outcomes. Methods/Design. Using two electronic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature describing livelihoods policies or interventions that included documentation of gendered impacts. We focused on natural resource-based livelihoods most likely to be affected by climate change, centering on interventions targeting agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry. Review Results/Synthesis. We identified 131 relevant articles, most of which focus on adoption or participation in interventions rather than outcomes. In general, women are less likely than men to engage with sustainable livelihoods interventions. When women do engage, some researchers have documented income and food security gains as well as improvements in environmental indicators in the short-term. However, these initiatives have also been found to increase women's labor burden without corresponding gains in income. Few studies measure longer-term effects of women's engagement on welfare and environmental outcomes, a key gap in the literature. Additionally, relatively few studies explore the intersectional impacts of initiatives, such as the added burdens of ethnicity, class, education, or other differences that modify gender disparities. Discussion. Climate change has gendered impacts on natural resource-based livelihoods. In general, existing initiatives designed to increase livelihood resilience fail to reduce gender disparities and improve women's livelihoods. Greater attention should be paid to gender when designing sustainable livelihoods policies and interventions in order to increase adoption and participation, negotiate trade-offs, improve environmental conditions, and promote broadly beneficial welfare outcomes. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Access to resources, both material and social, are central elements in responding to social and environmental transition, and adapting to change, yet the ways in which such access is negotiated within and across varying household structures is not well understood. In semi-arid Kenya, persistent drought has made male incomes from pastoralism insecure, and contributed to women's growing engagement with trade, farming and other independent enterprises, for survival. This has, however, raised questions about women's dependence on men for household provisioning, and enhanced expectations of reciprocity in both production and reproduction within households. While demographers note the rise in female headship in sub-Saharan Africa, and female headed households are often the target of policy attention, the situation on the ground is much more complex. Polygamy, separation and consensual unions, multi-generational and multi-locational households, point to a growing diversity in gender and generational relationships, in rights, responsibilities and norms. Based on data from household surveys, focus group discussions and life history interviews with differently positioned women and men within pastoralist communities in northern Kenya, the paper explores the implications of changing household structures beyond headship, in particular the loosening of marriage ties, frequent separation and regrouping, on relational vulnerability and the micro-politics of adaptation in the region. © 2019 The Author},

	abstract = {Kenya is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change-related stresses and extreme events. According to FAO, over 75% of the country is classified as arid and semiarid with rainfall availability and amounts quite unevenly spread across the different parts of the country. The country has very skewed distribution of water sources with the western area being relatively well endowed with abundant water resources. The exponential growth in the country’s population over the years, together with rapid environmental degradation and poor water resource development programs, have worsened the country’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change. Ethnic conflicts over land resources are common-place in Kenya’s rural areas where majority of the people live and the effects of extreme climate change events are likely to exacerbate resource-based conflicts. In this chapter we explore the extent of climate change-induced resource conflicts in three counties along rainfall availability gradient, namely, Kiambu County which experiences relatively high rainfall and also high urban population, Machakos County, which generally experiences modest rainfall availability, and Makueni County regarded to be one of the most arid and semiarid counties in the country. Data were collected in 2017 using a closed ended questionnaire. Between-subjects MANOVA design was used to examine relationship between independent and dependent variables. Qualitative results of the open-ended question reveal that climate change impacts can be diverse, particularly for vulnerable regions such as arid and semiarid regions such as Makueni County. In this county, respondents mentioned nine ways climate change had impacted communities, with the most frequently mentioned impact being increasing food insecurity followed by increasing water shortages. Machakos followed with seven impacts mentioned starting with increased water shortages followed by scarcity of pasture. In Kiambu County, only four impacts were mentioned with food insecurity being frequently mentioned among the list of impacts of climate change in the county. Results of the descriptive and inferential statistics reveal that resource-based conflicts vary along the hydrological gradient. In Machakos County, resource-based conflicts are perceived to have risen during the last 5 years (M = 3.92, SD = 0.66), followed by Makueni (M = 4.10, SD = 0.670). Kiambu residents do not consider resource-based conflicts to have risen during the last 5 year, (M = 2.50, SD = 1.38). Differences in severity of climate related conflicts are statistically significant, F 2, 76 = 12.78, p <0.01. Also, climate change is strongly perceived to be a factor in the rise of resource-based conflicts in Machakos County (M = 4.10, SD = 0.67). In Makueni County as well, climate change is perceived to be a significant contributor to resource-based conflicts (M = 3.98, SD = 1.70). These findings have relevance on county and national policies targeted to build capacity to cope with climate change induced resource-based conflicts among grassroot communities in Kenya. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Gendered vulnerability and its implications for people's ability to cope with and adapt to climatic stressors was investigated in four poor rural communities in Dimla, Kaunia, Hatibandha, and Patgram upazilas (sub-districts) in Rangpur division in the lower Teesta basin area in northwest Bangladesh. These areas are strongly affected by seasonal floods, flash floods, river bank erosion, and drought throughout the year. Socioeconomic stressors coupled with these climatic stressors lead to a high level of gendered vulnerability among the villagers, which is likely to be exacerbated in extreme climatic situations. Asymmetrical gender divisions make women disproportionately vulnerable and decrease their coping and adaptive capacity in changed situations. The study showed that women are the most vulnerable amongst vulnerable groups, not simply as a result of their gender roles and responsibilities, but more as a result of discriminatory social norms and practices such as lack of property ownership, lack of education, early marriage, the dowry system, and acceptance of domestic violence against women, which further create barriers to women's mobility and economic empowerment. Women are conditioned to remain at home and not participate, or to wait for men to accompany them to most activities taking place in the public space. Although significant numbers of women have been engaging in income generating activities, creating cooperative funds, and saving money, this is still within the confines of their private space. Government policy to empower women through free education is partly effective but the dominant patriarchal practice of early marriage and dowry discourage women from coming forward. The study concludes that the prevalent gender discriminatory norms and practices must be addressed to achieve gender transformative change, which is an essential requirement for gender equity and inclusive social development. Government policies and programs should be revised to address women's practical and strategic needs for gender transformative change. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Climate change is a global threat, affecting the food security and food sovereignty of many depending on agriculture for their livelihoods. This is even more pronounced in Kenya, given their over-reliance on rain-fed crops and the frequency of floods and droughts in the country. Through qualitative interviews, this study set out to establish how climate change not only affects the food security, production and consumption of rural women farmers in Kakamega County, Kenya, but their response to climate shocks. Using resilience theory as a lens, we established that women use different pathways to mitigate the effects of climate change on their livelihoods. The study found that initially women adopt coping strategies that are reactive and not sustainable, but soon adapted their farming strategies, using their indigenous knowledge to exercise some control over both their food security and food sovereignty. Besides this, they use their human and social capital to expand their networks of support. By linking up to other organizations and gaining access to government support, they are able to challenge patriarchal relations that perpetuate poverty and inequality and bring about more transformative and sustainable responses to climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Out of 110 households studied, male household members were absent in 66 cases because they had migrated to nearby towns and regional centres for alternative livelihood options. Male members’ absence created opportunities for Gabura women to develop a range of novel adaptation strategies through engagement with aid agencies, changed gender roles, leveraging social capital and utilizing local knowledge. For example, women are increasingly contributing to income through works within and outside of the house in agricultural innovations and handmade productions. These adaptations are built on social capital and trust between community women and the NGOs through mobilization and sharing of local knowledge. Based on the findings, a framework for informed autonomous adaptation is proposed. The generalization of coastal women in developing contexts as passive victims of climate change due to social norms and instead highlights women’s active agencies in adaptation is challenged.

	abstract = {Purpose – South Asian region is a focal point owing to its vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive diseases, dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods, projected levels of crop decline in the region, and high rates of poverty and malnutrition. Women are particularly vulnerable to climate change and this affects women disproportionately during different extreme events. The purpose of this paper is to understand the issue of climate change and its impact, and climate resilience among women in South Asia. Further, it also identifies the gaps and suggests future policy implications. Design/methodology/approach – Climate change is increasingly being recognised as an alarming issue and the present review is important when South Asian countries are facing the brunt of climate change impacts. This paper tries to understand the issue by review of the literature and conceptual framework methodology. To understand women’s vulnerability due to climate change and its aftermath, the authors conducted both offline and online desk reviews for this study. Findings – The findings of this study show a clear linkage between climate change and women’s vulnerabilities in South Asia. Climate change has significant socio-economic impacts on women, and it affects them disproportionately in various domains of agriculture, livelihood, food security, both physical and mental health, water and sanitation in the South Asia region. Practical implications – The paper also highlights that the programmes that aim at combating the effects of climate change require a gender-sensitive approach so that climate change does not obstruct the development and reduction of poverty in the region. Social implications – The findings of this paper will add value in helping families to come out of poverty by undertaking adaptive measures with proactive assistance from the government and grassroots level organisations. Originality/value – The present study also advocates for more gender-and climate-sensitive measures from governments, and implementation of intervention-and evidence-based research in the South Asian countries. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Climate adaptation efforts are recurrent in the science and policy spheres, especially in the context of the adaptation of community-driven, small-scale farming systems. One such is subsistence farming, which constitutes the backbone of most rural sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies, including Cameroon. Significant research and policy efforts have been directed towards overcoming barriers to climate adaptation. Such efforts have tackled a range of socio-economic and exogenous institutional constraints. However, knowledge gaps exist in the climate adaptation literature, particularly with regards to the extent to which endogenous cultural institutions (customary rules) in SSA shape gender (in)equality in access to productive resources like land. Based on a representative survey of 87 female-headed households in rural Cameroon, we contribute to bridge this gap by determining endogenous cultural institutional constraints to rural women's climate adaptation, specifically with regards to their access to land for subsistence farming. Results were obtained with logistic regression analysis and a chi-square test of independence, showing that: (i) an inverse relationship exists between discriminatory cultural practices and women farmers' capacity to adapt to climate change, and that (ii) tenure insecurity and inequality amplifies farmer's vulnerability to long- and short-term climatic change. While this paper contributes to existing theoretical frameworks on climate adaptation from an institutional perspective, it equally makes a succinct request for further studies to be undertaken to ground this theoretical assertion. © 2019 by the authors.},

As climate change adaptation gains increasing prominence in global environmental policies and development strategies, there is a tendency to conceptualize adaptation as a technical process, disconnected from the everyday reality of how adaptation is practised by people facing negative climate change impacts. We present evidence from a small-scale case study of a flood-prone informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to provide a contextually grounded contribution to a growing body of literature on gender, climate change and cities. We argue that the way climate change impacts are perceived, experienced and adapted to on an everyday level is characterized by gendered differences (among others).

They are actively engaged in agricultural activities and thus are exposed to climate change impacts. Despite the abundent literature on climate change, little is known about the participation of rural women in the adaptation decision-making process. Drawing on this research gap, the major attempt of this paper is to analyze women participation in climate change adaptation decisionmaking at the household-level. The study was conducted in the municipal areas of Bembéréké and Banikoara in North Benin. Primary data were collected by using a survey method on 120 households randomly selected. In each household, the husband and his wife were interviewed separately. By using a composite index of participation, the results showed that the level of women participation was quite low when it comes to identify problems, formulate alternatives and plan activities, allocate resources and participate in the evaluation of activities and outcomes for feedback purposes. However, women were more involved in the implementation of farming activities and, as well, took advantages of the economic, social, political or other benefits emanating from these activities. Furthermore, the analysis of the socio-economic drivers of women participation highlighted that women and men access to education, women experience in agriculture, women contact with extension services and women land ownership are positively correlated with her participation in household climate change decision-making process. This suggests that research institutes and policy makers could carry out actions or programs aiming at enhancing women access to education, extension services, and production resources. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Social capital facilitates adaptation to climate change. Planned community-based adaptation (CBA) therefore – often implemented by non-governmental organisations – seeks to engender social capital to strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities in the Global South. CBA interventions typically seek to build social capital through the formation of community-based organisations, often led by the most vulnerable groups such as poor women, with the view that these groups will sustain and make efforts to strengthen community capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper presents the results of a research project that sought to understand the challenges of building social capital through group-based CBA interventions in the rural coastal communities of Bangladesh. Drawing on the accounts of four female-led community organisations and their respective communities, we argue that strengthening social capital was obstructed by embedded sociocultural norms and by the assumptions made by external organisations about how to create social capital. This study concludes that CBA needs to frame gender from an intersectional point of view, rather than a simplistic ‘male-versus-female dichotomy’ to build community capacities through female-led collectives. It thus contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature on social capital, gender and community adaptation. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Climate change has diverse physical and socio-economic implications for communities in semi-arid areas. While several studies have sought to understand the underlying power relations that shape adaptive capacities of rural farmers, fewer studies have focused on unpacking the differences within the different social groups. In this paper, we present a case study based on women smallholder farmers from semi-arid Ghana. It explores their nuanced perceptions of climate variability and highlights how gender intersects with other identities, roles and responsibilities to influence adaptation strategies and barriers to adaptation in the semi-arid context. Farm-level data was collected from 103 women farmers using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Rainfall patterns were perceived by the women farmers to be increasingly erratic and perceptions of average temperatures were that they are increasing. Adoption of adaptation strategies were influenced by socio-demographic factors such as age, marital and residential status, which also influenced decision-making and power dynamics within the household. The paper highlighted the complex relationships that mediate women farmers’ access to resources and influence their vulnerability to climate variability and change. Highlighting the intra-gender differences that shaped the adaptation options and adaptive capacity is a prerequisite for proper adaptation policy planning and targeting. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Looking at two BRACED (Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters) projects, in Burkina Faso and in Ethiopia, this article uses a desk review and primary data from partners and people at risk to explore how a gender-transformative approach can be an integral part of resilience-building projects, particularly those implemented by multi-stakeholder consortia. It also suggests ways to incorporate a stronger gender component in similar future projects. The article argues that donors and programme managers must provide clear principles and guidelines for achieving gender equity within resilience-building efforts. However, these must allow flexibility to adapt to norms, needs and resources as determined by implementing partners. The right balance can be achieved by facilitating spaces for individual and collective goal-setting; assessing current capacity and trajectories; and lesson-sharing as an iterative process for institutional learning. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The effects of environmental change are becoming more noticeable in the Lower Mekong Basin, where there is growing pressure on the agriculture-based livelihoods of communities living along the mainstream of the Mekong River. This chapter presents an investigation of temporal seasonal variability in four communities of Kratie Province, Cambodia, including identification of locally developed strategies to adapt to temporal changes in weather patterns. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining historical hydrometeorological data with participatory seasonal calendars and daily routine diaries. Seasonal calendars were compiled from nine workshops across four villages in Kratie Province, and daily diaries were collected from seven individuals across three villages. The results indicate that patterns in rainfall, flooding and drought have become more variable due to the impacts of environmental change; a phenomenon that will likely continue into the future. Without effective, locally appropriate adaptation measures, changing weather patterns will likely continue to have adverse impacts on communities in the region due to their reliance on reliable seasonal rainfall and flooding events for crop cultivation. Households and communities in the study region have already developed a number of approaches to mitigate the adverse impacts of environmental change. This research also reiterated the importance of incorporating both local knowledge and scientific data to gain the most accurate understanding of the impacts of environmental change in a given region. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Using data from national and sub-national policy actors in Uganda (37 semi-structured interviews, 78 questionnaires), the study found that policy actors largely adhered to global gender discourses in proposing context-specific solutions to gender inequality. Our results show that although local actors identified local norms and culture as major barriers to gender equality, their proposed solutions did not address local gender norms, focussed on formal policy and did little to address underlying causes of gender inequalities. Based on the findings, we suggest that ‘the local’ should be reconstructed as a deliberative space where a wide variety of actors, including local feminist organisations, critically engage, assess and address local gender inequality patterns in agriculture and climate change adaptation processes. © 2021 The Author(s).

There is no denying the fact that climate change is bringing miseries for the vulnerable population particularly for the rural women. The study used the Treatment Effect Model to evaluate the determinants of women’s perception and adoption of coping strategies using data from Climate Change Impact Survey (PIDE 2013). Secondary data of 3298 rural households in Punjab, Sindh and KPK as provided by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (2013) were utilized to conduct this research. The results of this study demonstrate that age, education, farming experience, land rights, women empowerment, livestock ownership and change in rainfall are crucial factors for women’s coping strategies to avoid the adverse effect of climate change. There is dire need to raise awareness about climate change in women and provide credit facilities for undertaking adaptation measures, encourage informal social networks and enhance women capacity to climate change. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {While people around the world are increasingly facing various climate-related stresses, women with limited resources in low income developing societies are often at a greater risk largely because of their pre-existing constraints on social, economic, political, and cultural resources and opportunities. In this paper, we investigate how gender differences influence farmers’ access to various resources that are critical for local climate adaptation in coastal Bangladesh. As one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in not only the country but the world, coastal Bangladesh is experiencing a significant increase in sea level rise, tropical cyclones, storm surges, coastal flooding, coastal erosions as well as unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these climate related stresses directly contribute to the region’s increasing exposure to saltwater intrusion in coastal lands and freshwater sources. While a majority of the previous research has focused on community-based climate adaptation, there has been limited attention on how gender differences shape local farmers’ climate adaptation strategies. Using mixed-methods research, this article highlights the ways in which male-headed and female-headed farming households have differential access to locally available adaptation resources along with associated constraints or opportunities for adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies vary substantially. Our findings suggest female-headed farms are less likely to sell their farmland or migrate away in search of non-farm income due to normative gendered expectations and socio-cultural restrictions. Therefore, female farmers are forced to pursue in-place farming adaptation strategies with limited external resources while relying on informal social networks for weather and climate information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Gender mediates climate vulnerability and adaptation action. Consequently, climate change adaptation policy has seen a push towards ‘mainstreaming’ gender and prioritizing ‘gender-responsive’ climate action. However, it is unclear to what extent this mainstreaming advances or obscures gender considerations and whether current climate policies reflect developments in the gender and climate change literature. This paper explores how gender is operationalized in adaptation policy in India through a policy review of 28 State Action Plans on Climate Change. We juxtapose normative goals around reducing differential vulnerability with policy approaches to mainstreaming gender and propose entry points that link advances in gender and feminist studies with climate change adaptation policy. Our analysis indicates that most subnational climate policies in India explicitly mention gender as a mediator of vulnerability and adaptive capacity but operationalize it inadequately and unevenly. We also reflect on how the heuristics of mainstreaming get operationalized in policies (gender-blind, gender-sensitive, to gender-transformative approaches) and what that means for addressing gendered vulnerability. Key policy insights While explicitly mentioned, gender concerns are unevenly operationalized in India's subnational climate policy. In most State Action Plans on Climate Change in India, gaps exist between normative goals such as reducing differential vulnerability and empowering women, and policy approaches (namely gender-blind, -neutral, -specific, -sensitive, and -transformative approaches). To be effective, the conceptualization of gender must expand beyond focussing on differences between women and men to engaging more with intersections of sex, caste, class, and resources. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The project focused on the human dimensions of climate change and adaptation of Austrian small-scale private forest owners to climate change. In Austria, approximately 95,000 forest owners manage roughly 56% of the forest area with individual properties covering less than 5 ha. Due to changing family structures and traditions, the number of female forest owners is increasing. This study is therefore primarily interested in the decision-making processes of female respondents. The findings are based on a survey, which applied a choice experiment (CE) to investigate forest owners' perceptions of climate change, their motivation for forest ownership and their planned management behaviour under conditions of climate change. Overall, a total of 919 forest owners participated in the questionnaire, 20% of which were female participants from all over Austria. Female forest owners were analysed in comparison to their male counterparts, focussing on the duration of forest ownership, motivation and their preferred forest tending and maintenance approaches. Furthermore, we analysed the likelihood of female participants to apply climate change adaptation strategies in their forests. The findings reveal significant differences and demonstrate that tailored approaches are required when reaching out to females in order to influence their decision-making processes. Therefore, new approaches are necessary, which are specifically addressed to female small-scale private forest owners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Multistage sampling procedure was used to select eighty respondents for the study. Data were collected through the use of semi-structured interview schedule and analysed with descriptive statistical tools such as frequency count, percentage, mean scores and standard deviation. The major effects of climate change on garden egg production were scarcity of floral resources (x = 3.00), increased spread of pests and pathogens (x̄ =2.78), reduced pollen production in flowers (x̄=2.68), increased garden egg susceptibility to pathogens (x̄ =2.67) and decreased quantity and quality of garden egg production (x̄ =2.67). The effectiveness of adaptation strategies used by women in garden egg production were change of farming sites (x̄ =2.97), establishment of water reserve and farming close to irrigated area (x̄=2.92). The identified constraints to adapting to the present climate change scenario included: unstable weather (x̄=3.00), unavailability of modern harvesting techniques (x̄=2.75), increased pest and disease pathogens (x̄=2.68) and poor access to materials and equipment (x̄=2.63). Hence, this study recommends provision of incentives such as materials and equipment’s and increased training of garden egg farmers on how to reduce and prevent pests and diseases outbreak. © 2021.

	abstract = {The study takes an equality justice perspective to compare resilience against the controlled management of wildfires, for an effective preparedness, which is a prerequisite for equitable mitiga-tion. The objectives were (a) conceptualizing wildfire mitigation by exploring the ties with gender equality to wildfire hazards, (b) taking the case of wildfire 2018 in Mati, Greece, to contribute reducing the country’s gender inequality, and (c) increasing resilience to climate change hazards by considering lessons learnt. The authors underscore the benefits of a workshop-based and instrumental case study methodology for unravelling evidence on the need for gender-sensitive approaches and tools for future planning at local, regional, and global scales. The case study unravels women’s lack of preparedness to wildfires in Greece, their absence in decision-making for fire management, and the need for capacity building to transform communities’ resilience. The literature research and the specific interviews conducted helped bring awareness to the wildfire’s dynamics, in alignment with the fundamental aspect of gender equality, and to ground recommendations for socio-ecological resilience transition and gender-sensitive approaches in fire management, from reactive fire-fighting to proactive integration. Although in the geographical-context, the study can bring widespread geographical awareness, bringing insights for relevance to similar areas worldwide. © 2021 by the authors.

A participatory action approach, in the form of a community workshop, was employed, which separated participants into community identified groupings. Differences in community groups' adaptation preferences emerged, though the range of adaptation measures considered were limited, probably due to the participants’ limited exposure to adaptation mechanisms in their immediate surroundings. Overall, the communities surveyed tended to be conservative, especially in their attitudes towards western adaptation solutions developed in non-island contexts. © 2020 The Authors},

These constraints result in low adaptive capacity of women, which make them more vulnerable to hazards. As more men seek employment opportunities away from home, women are required to acquire new capacities to manage new challenges, including risks from climate change. An action research was conducted to assess impacts of capacity building interventions for women left behind in enhancing adaptive capacity of migrant-sending households in rural areas vulnerable to floods in Nepal. This study finds that capacity-building interventions, which aimed to strengthen autonomous adaptation measures (e.g. precautionary savings and flood preparedness), also positively influenced women to approach formal institutions. Besides, the intervention households were more likely to invest a part of the precautionary savings in flood preparedness measures than control households. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Floods account for a majority of disasters, especially in South Asia, where they affect 27 million people annually, causing economic losses of over US$1 billion. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these risks. Risk transfer mechanisms, such as weather index insurance (WII) may help buffer farmers against these hazards. However, WII programs struggle to attract the clients most in need of protection, including marginalized women and men. This risks re-enforcing existing inequalities and missing opportunities to promote pro-poor and gender-sensitive development. Key questions, therefore, include what factors constrain access to WIIs amongst heterogeneous communities, and how these can be addressed. This paper contributes to that end through primary data from two WII case studies (one in India, the other in Bangladesh) that identify contextual socio-economic and structural barriers to accessing WII, and strategies to overcome these. More significantly, this paper synthesizes the case study findings and those from a review of the literature on other WII initiatives into a framework to promote a systematic approach to address these challenges: an important step forward in moving from problem analysis to remedial action. The framework highlights actions across WII product design, implementation and post-implementation, to minimize risks of social exclusion in future WII schemes. © 2019 by the authors.},

But who are ‘we’ in the Anthropocene, how do notions of our shared humanity contend with the cascading global inequalities of place, race, class and gender. Oceania is often said to have contributed the least and suffered the most from climate change. Pacific women, and especially those living on low lying atolls, have been portrayed as the most vulnerable to the disastrous consequences of climate change. This focuses on sea level rise and the toxic mixing, the elemental confusion of salt and fresh water caused by atmospheric changes and global warming. While not negating the gravity of present and future scenarios, how can we move beyond the pervasive fatalism of foreign framings and seemingly opposed clichéd evocations of ‘resilience’? The moniker of the Pacific Climate Warriors 350.org ‘ We are not drowning, we are fighting’ evokes a contrary trope of resistance and resonates with Oceanic activism in politics and the creative arts.1 Tracing such a genealogy of resistance might start with a greater respect for Indigenous knowledges and embodied practices in contemporary understandings of ‘climate cultures’ in Oceania which do not routinely distinguish between natural and human history. © UTS ePRESS.

Offering a nuanced assessment of vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience, the chapter argues for a commitment to transformative resilience to address the potential for gender inequalities to be cemented by climate-based actions. Noting the widespread dominance of climate denial amongst policy makers and the slow and incremental attention to gender at international climate forums, the chapter notes the need for critical attention to gender. Outlining the gender impacts of health impacts, food and water insecurity, and displacement, the chapter notes that gender, poverty, and rurality are critical elements of vulnerability. Moving forward the chapter calls for attention to the complexity of gender and power relations in climate change policies and practices to give the lie to the simplistic notion of women as vulnerable or virtuous. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Margaret Alston.},

	abstract = {The negative impact of disasters induced by climate change, if not proactively managed, could erode gains attained in the fight for gender equality in Botswana. This could lead to disempowerment, increased levels of poverty, and weakened resilience to climatological and related disasters. Empirical research on the impact of climatological disasters has centered primarily on livelihoods (agriculture and environment). However, limited research has been undertaken on the built environment. This article attempts to address the knowledge gap by exploring the resilience of women in the built environment, or more specifically, by examining rural Batswana women's resilience factors in the built environment and how these (houses/huts) could be further enhanced to withstand the impact of climatological hazards. It followed a qualitative research design and used a capability and gender analysis lens. The key findings indicate that women cannot afford to construct disaster-resilient residential structures due to existing power imbalances perpetuated by patriarchy. Women as caretakers of their families stay at home and are usually the last to evacuate or leave their places of residence when disasters eventuate. As a result, women were found to have higher levels of poverty, could not afford durable building material, had inadequate technical skills, and were generally climate illiterate. Consequently, the structures they construct are weak, less durable, and a potential risk to them and their families. Despite these challenges, women show signs of resilience rather than victimhood. © 2020 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Through the application of traditional and contemporary feminist theories in gender mainstreaming, the purpose of this paper is to contribute to emergent debate on gender dimensions in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption by smallholder farmers in disaster-prone regions. This is important to ensure that CSA strategies are tailored to farmer-specific gender equality goals. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory-sequential mixed methods research design which is qualitatively biased was applied. Key informant interviews and farmer focus group discussions in two study sites formed initial qualitative phase whose findings were explored in a quantitative cross-sectional household survey. Findings: Findings shared in this paper indicate the predominant application of traditional gender mainstreaming approaches in CSA focusing on parochial gender dichotomy. Qualitative findings highlight perceptions that western gender approaches are not fully applicable to local contexts and realities, with gender mainstreaming in CSA seemingly to fulfil donor requirements, and ignorant of the heterogeneous nature of social groups. Quantitative findings establish that married men are majority adopters and non-adopters of CSA, while dis-adopters are predominantly de jure female household heads. The latter are more likely to adopt CSA than married women whose main role in CSA is implementers of spouse’s decisions. Access to education, intra-household power relations, productive asset and land ownership are socio-cultural dynamics shaping farmer profiles. Originality/value: By incorporating African feminisms and intersectionality in CSA, value of this study lies in recommending gender policy reforms incorporating local gender contexts within the African socio-cultural milieu. This paper accentuates potential benefits of innovative blend of both contemporary and classic gender mainstreaming approaches in CSA research, practice and technology development in disaster-prone regions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The possibilities for ecological masculinities—i.e. masculinities that would go hand-in-hand with climate change adaptation—to emerge in such communities and subcultures during these times of climate change are underway. Based on ethnographic research in Nicaragua, one of the most climate change affected countries in the world, I discuss the making and performances of the hegemonic masculinities of cattle ranchers and how they are affected by climate change in general and deforestation in particular.

	abstract = {This study assessed the livelihood strategies adopted by husbands and wives within the same households for coping with climate-induced food insecurity in Southeast Nigeria. Collective and bargaining approaches were used in collecting individual and intra-household-level data of 120 pairs of spouses in Southeast Nigeria; husbands and wives were interviewed separately. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys were used to elicit responses from the respondents. Quantitative data for the study were analyzed using percentage, mean scores, and multinomial logit regression analysis. Results of the study revealed that 90% of the wives were more food insecure than their husbands (79.2%). The respondents noted that the observed changes in the climate contributed immensely to their food insecurity situation. To cope with food insecurity, a slightly higher proportion (47.3% and 14.2%) of wives adopted on-farm and non-farm strategies, respectively, while men (39.8%) adopted more off-farm strategies (38.5%). Additionally, results of the multinomial logit regression revealed that market distance and credit access significantly influenced the choice of husbands’ and wives’ engagement in off-farm livelihood strategy; sourcing information on climate change issues significantly influenced women’s choice of engagement in off-farm/non-farm strategy; and receiving remittances significantly influenced men’s choice of engagement in non-farm strategy. The study concluded that, although women play crucial roles in addressing food insecurity within their households, gender-specific obstacles typically impede their abilities to cope with climate-induced food insecurity. © 2020, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.},

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to obtain the actual condition of the vulnerability of coastal women in facing climate change in the city of Makassar, which includes aspects of individual capacity and organizational capacity, as well as systems in the city of Makassar. To find the ideal strategy to manage the vulnerability of coastal women to disasters and climate change in the city of Makassar. The research method uses a qualitative-exploratory method with a phenomenological approach. The data sources used are primary and secondary data. Data collection techniques through field studies and literature studies. The data analysis technique used is an interactive model. The results of the study show that women's vulnerability in coastal areas is caused in addition by erratic rainfall as well as policy gaps related to women concerning climate change in the city of Makassar and the government's commitment to ensuring the protection of women's rights through a half-hearted urban climate policy. Furthermore, the ideal strategy in ecosystem-based adaptive governance is to manage the vulnerability of coastal women.  © 2021 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Vietnam is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially from extreme weather events such as storms and floods. Thus, climate change adaptation is crucial, especially for natural resource-dependent farmers. Based on a qualitative research approach using a feminist political ecology lens, this article investigates gendered patterns of rural agrarian livelihoods and climate adaptation in the province of Thái Bình. In doing so, we identify differentiated rights and responsibilities between female and male farmers, leading to unequal opportunities and immobility for females, making them more vulnerable to climate impacts and threatening to reduce their capacity to adapt. This research also shows that demands on farmers to contribute to perpetual increases in agricultural output by the state poses a challenge, since farming livelihoods in Vietnam are increasingly becoming feminised, as a result of urbanisation and devaluation of farming. Past and present national strategies and provincial implementation plans linked to climate change do not consider the burden affecting rural female farmers, instead the focus lies on addressing technical solutions to adaptation. With little attention being paid to an increasingly female workforce, existing gender inequalities may be exacerbated, threatening the future existence of rural livelihoods and the viability of Vietnam's expansion into global markets. © 2019 by the authors.},

Female and male farmers are differently affected by climate change, and they have different responses to and ability to cope with climate change. Men and women in Son Tho commune, a mountainous rural site in Ha Tinh province, Vietnam, were surveyed to determine what ecosystems and services they depend on, what losses and damage from climate change they are facing, and identify any appropriate ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) measures that could be implemented to build resilience. Data were collected at meetings with commune staff and male and female farmers through open-ended and structured questionnaires and focus-group discussions. Both groups acknowledged that livelihoods of people in the study area are ecosystem-based. Perceived changes in the local climate included an increase in heat waves; more intense droughts due to delays in the onset of rain and reduction in total annual rainfall; cold spells; typhoons; and floods. The influences of these phenomena on livelihoods were interpreted differently by female and male farmers. As a result, EbA interventions are defined and selected differently by gender. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess gender-based differences on farmers’ perception of impacts and vulnerability to climate change and the implementation of adaptation strategies in the Pra River Basin of Ghana, while also providing lessons for other Sub-Saharan nations and regions with similar conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The study used semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to collect data from 344 farmers, 64 participants in focus group discussions and 6 agriculture extension officers (key informants) from 10 districts in the Pra River Basin of Ghana. Findings: Results showed several differences in how climate change is perceived and tackled by male and female genders. In the perception of male farmers, for example, they were found to be more vulnerable to increased temperature, and changes in rainfall and growing season, whereas female farmers on average were considered to be less resilient to floods and droughts for different reasons. Moreover, floods posed higher risks to farming than other climate change impacts. Gender roles had a significant correlation with the type of adaptation strategies practised. Men adopted agrochemicals more often than women, as an adaptation strategy. Research limitations/implications: Gender-differentiated interventions should be incorporated in the national climate change action plan for sustainable development in a rain-fed agricultural economy such as Ghana. The study recommends several actions to promote gender equity in the assessed region. Originality/value: This research assessed the gender differentials in climate trends, impact, vulnerability and adaptation based on primary data collected between April and May 2019 and compared the results with climate data in the basin for the period 1991–2014. It is an empirical study focused on primary data analysis obtained in loco by authors, involving approximately 400 participants. © 2021, Enoch Bessah, AbdulGaniy Olayinka Raji, Olalekan John Taiwo, Sampson Kwaku Agodzo, Olusola Oluwayemisi Ololade, Alexandre Strapasson and Emmanuel Donkor.},

In this paper, I present an in-depth case study to demonstrate how the persistence of gender-based inequality in community forestry has, or is likely to have, impacted the possibility to adapt to climate change, and then also reshape gender relations in adaptation interventions. Based on this, I argue that adaptation initiatives which rest on existing gender inequitable forest management institutions are likely to exacerbate gender-based inequality, further hampering the longer-term socio-ecological resilience. Although gender inequality is not created solely either by forestry institutions or in the institutions designed for climate adaptation, community forestry institutions are increasingly reinforcing the larger patriarchal societal structure that is deeply rooted and manifested in everyday practices. I highlight the need for both forest management and adaptation policies and practices to better recognize, appreciate and address gender inequality. In order to enhance gender-equitable adaptation to climate change, I suggest re-examining and constantly monitoring the changing gender in/equality in the existing forest management institutions and service delivery mechanisms and also adjusting adaptation planning to fully harness the potential of gender equitable forest management and climate change adaptation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, while research is increasingly moving away from understanding the relationship between gender and climate change in a linear, technocratic, and instrumental way, gender and climate change policy-makers and project practitioners are having difficulties operationalizing this progress. In the meantime, as climate change effects are increasingly felt worldwide, and because the policy context after the Paris Agreement (2015) is bringing new challenges for gender and equity concerns, (re-)politicizing the climate justice debate in a policy and project-relevant way is more crucial than ever. My aim in this article is to contribute to this endeavor by exploring how a feminist political ecology framework applied to a specific case study in Nicaragua—one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world—can generate new policy and project-relevant lessons and insights from the ground that can in turn strengthen the conceptual debate on gender and climate change adaptation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2013 and 2014, as well as eight years of professional experience as a development worker in Nicaragua, I discuss the workings of power in the feminist political ecology of climate change adaptation; in so doing I raise new questions that will, I hope, lead policy-makers and project practitioners to explore how adaptation processes could open up the conceptual possibility for emancipation, transformation, and new ways of living life in common. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on a feminist political ecology framework and a mixed method approach, this research performs an empirical analysis of two case studies in the northern of India, one in the Himalayan Mountains and another in the Indian-Gangetic plains. It explores context-specific (i) influence of gender roles and responsibilities on on-farm agrobiodiversity management (ii) gendered expertise and knowledge related to agrobiodiversity and (iii) gendered preferences for practices and institutional arrangements for agrobiodiversity conservation linked to adaptation to climate change. In the Himalayan mountains women actively participate in crop and seed management decisions and tasks, and maintain informal institutions for seed and services exchanges in the case of crisis, which simultaneously favours high levels of agrobiodiversity and enhances women’s social status. By contrast, in the Indio-Gangetic plains, where women from better-off households are socially secluded and women from poorer households work mainly as labourer to respond to high out-migration of men, they exercise less public control over agrobiodiversity, with their role being mainly invisible at the homestead and related to post-production tasks. We finally discuss as improved understanding of the links between gendered spaces, crops, tasks, social status, and agrobiodiversity management can facilitate the design of gender-sensitive policy interventions for conservation and adaptation to climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {It is a widely accepted notion that climate change affects men and women within agrarian populations differently; consequently, their adaptation strategies are gendered. Besides climate change, women’s vulnerability and their corresponding adaptation strategies are embedded within a complex web of social identities/status, agroecological location, gender norm/roles and power struggles within the plurality of normative orders governing land (property rights). This chapter focuses on Cameroon and seeks to analyze how the interactions between various normative orders governing access to land, co-dependent upon the multiple gendered identities (intersectionality), impact climate change adaptation strategies of female farmers. The results show that the degree of vulnerability and adaptation strategies of women are context specific and gendered across the five distinct agroecological zones of Cameroon. Furthermore, secured access to and ownership over land is crucial in determining the adaptation choices and options available to female farmers. A complex mix of state and non-state norms govern property rights in Cameroon, within which women have to constantly negotiate their land claims. These negotiations are influenced by marital status, ethnicity, educational level, and community/social relations, such that the outcome translates differently for women within the Muslim, Anglophone, and Francophone communities. The chapter concludes with context-specific recommendations to strengthen the adaptive capacity of agrarian women across Cameroon. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.},

The chapter gender analyzed the aspects of climate change impacts; identified the indigenous and expert-based artificial adaptation strategies; assessed the gender differences in the adaptation strategies; and provided the gender implications of the indigenous adaptation strategies among actors along the AVC. The chapter adopted a value chain-based exploratory design with gender analysis as the narrative framework with Gender Response Theory as the theoretical background. There were gender differences in the production, economic, and social dimensions of the climate change impacts along the AVC. The indigenous climate change adaptation strategies were availability, low cost, and easily accessible; hence they were popularly adopted by male and female AVC actors. The adopted indigenous adaptation strategies challenged the social relations, influenced reordering of social and gender relations, participation, and power relation among the male and female actors along the AVC. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.},

Critical scholarly insights demonstrate the roles of power and agency in determining social difference and shaping adaptive capacities across geographical contexts. Framings of resilience and adaptation have shifted to acknowledge and examine these dynamic processes and how they are deliberated and negotiated in practice. We utilise an intersectional subjectivities lens and the notion of ‘negotiated resilience’ as proposed by Harris and colleagues (2018) to assess the inner workings of power and agency in rural Ghanaian farming communities. Specifically, we demonstrate how new entryways for contesting and deliberating power relations can be opened, or conversely closed, within participatory arenas, here during three co-learning workshops on gender and climate change adaptation. Such insights are valuable for researchers and social actors alike to create mindful and practical spaces for (re)negotiating gendered inequalities, as a vital step toward transference into everyday realities. Ultimately, we argue that persistent and collaborative efforts at subverting and (re)negotiating inequitable processes of power in specific contexts is crucial for creating meaningful pathways toward climate justice. © 2020},

	abstract = {Climate change has the most severe impact on women, but studies on adaptation in a gender perspective are still limited. The purposes of this study were to find out: (1) gender role changes in response to climate change, and (2) the impact of gender role changes on the vulnerability of women. This study was conducted on the peat-swamp ecosystem in Pulang Pisau Regency, Central Kalimantan. Gender roles in natural resource management in adapting to climate change in the peat-swamp ecosystem were descriptively qualitatively analyzed which emphasized relations and gender roles in the household. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. This study used documentation methods with secondary data types. From the results of the study, it can be seen that the gender role of women is divided into three, namely productive roles, reproductive roles, and social community roles. Climate change in Pulang Pisau Regency will interact and be sustainable with gender inequality and which disadvantages women than men, especially among the poor community, so that access to the availability of natural resources is needed in order to solve existing vulnerabilities and increase more real participation in the current climate change adaptation process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The survey results indicate that only 40.37% of the women have adapted to CC against 59.62% of the men. Moreover, being member of farmer-based organization (FBO), access to credit and extension services, agricultural training of women are the main factors that increase the likelihood of adaptation. The gender-differentiated impact shows that women would earn more than men from adaptation, while losing compared to men if they do not take any adaptation actions. The loss from non-adapting to CC will increase by 0.268% of the soybean revenue. However, the heterogeneity effects suggest further assessment on the adopted technology in soybean farming in the study areas. Adaptation policy that seeks to ensure food security and enhance farmers’ welfare in subsistence agriculture should consider the gender dimension, while reviewing the financial policy in terms of affordability, access of extension services and supporting FBO will increase technologies adoption and farming revenue. © 2020 The Author(s).

This paper explores the involvement and inclusion of women in participatory spaces in the Decentralized Climate Funds pilot project in Senegal to evaluate whether only the voices and demands of the powerful and vocal few were raised and heard. Using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions, the paper explores and analyzes the factors motivating and constraining women's active and empowered meaningful participation. The findings reveal that women in the Kaffrine region of Senegal experienced different levels of participation in community decision-making, ranging from nominal and passive participation to active and substantive participation. Results highlight that women's social capital and networks, community-level recognition of women's role in income generation, and favorable intrahousehold power dynamics were instrumental in encouraging active and empowered participation. The paper finds that the community-based adaptation approach of devolving decision-making to the community level is by itself not sufficient to ensure that women can meaningfully access the participatory process. Future community-based adaptation initiatives can improve their approach and ensure that women are able to voice their needs by understanding the local gender dynamics and designing projects to acknowledge and work within those dynamics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Crop diversification is a form of adaptation to climate change that reduces exposure to climate-related risks and has also been shown to increase diet diversity, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and positively affect agro-ecological systems. Despite these benefits, the level of crop diversification in Bangladesh remains extremely low, requiring an examination of the factors that support uptake of this practice. This paper explores whether women’s empowerment, measured using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), leads to increased diversification in the use of farmland. Our results reveal that some aspects of women’s empowerment in agriculture, but not all, lead to more diversification and to a transition from cereal production to other crops like vegetables and fruits. These findings suggest a possible pathway for gender-sensitive interventions that promote crop diversity as a risk management tool and as a way to improve the availability of nutritious crops. © 2020, The Author(s).},

They are actively engaged in agricultural activities and thus are exposed to climate change impacts. Despite the abundent litterature on climate change, little is known about the participation of rural women in the adaptation decision-making process. Drawing on this research gap, the major attempt of this paper is to analyze women participation in climate change adaptation decisionmaking at the household-level. The study was conducted in the municipal areas of Bembéréké and Banikoara in North Benin. Primary data were collected by using a survey method on 120 households randomly selected. In each household, the husband and his wife were interviewed separately. By using a composite index of participation, the results showed that the level of women participation was quite low when it comes to identify problems, formulate alternatives and plan activities, allocate resources and participate in the evaluation of activities and outcomes for feedback purposes. However, women were more involved in the implementation of farming activities and, as well, took advantages of the economic, social, political or other benefits emanating from these activities. Furthermore, the analysis of the socio-economic drivers of women participation highlighted that women and men access to education, women experience in agriculture, women contact with extension services and women land ownership are positively correlated with her participation in household climate change decision-making process. This suggests that research institutes and policy makers could carry out actions or programs aiming at enhancing women access to education, extension services, and production resources. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

The broad objective of this study is to integrate gender issues into climate change adaptation thereby distilling lessons and evidence for policymakers on how to approach the necessary transformation of gender relations in climate change interventions. The study employed focus group discussions to uncover the structural factors undermining women’s adaptive capacity, thereby making them vulnerable to climate change impacts. In addition to this, in-depth interviews were also conducted. For the in-depth interviews, 27 farmers were sampled using a snowballing method, while four focus groups were carried out differently for male and female farmers. Ten extension personnel and ten representations from the ministry of agriculture were also surveyed using in-depth interviews. Results from the study showed that female farmers in the region were more vulnerable to climate change as a result of the deeply rooted cultural systems and unwarranted assumptions about women. Findings also suggested that women with high adaptive capacity were less vulnerable to climate impacts. We conclude that gender-responsive climate change adaptation is important in achieving balanced relations that will ensure climate resilience in more equitable and nonhierarchical ways. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.},

Our results indicate that adaptation strategies are gendered with men mostly resorting to on-farm agronomic practices such as the use of artificial fertilizers and also moving into new cash crops. Female farmers also use similar on-farm agronomic practices particularly artificial fertilizers to boost crop production but most importantly resorted to petty trading in agricultural and consumable goods, an off-farm strategy. This shows women’s resilience which has also subsequently improved their decision-making role at the household level, which is an indicator of empowerment. We recommend that institutions that support climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level must take gender differences into consideration and support particularly women to strengthen their resilience and consolidate their empowerment. © 2017, © 2017 The African Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers.},

	abstract = {Women are the largest proportion of the world's poor, including children and young women. Women are very vulnerable to climate change. But until now gender considerations are still not explicitly stated in various climate change policies. In the marine and fisheries sector, extreme climate change makes many fishermen unable to go to sea and fish declines. The unequal division of gender roles causes the level of vulnerability to climate change to differ between women and men. This study aims to analyze the vulnerability and gender roles of fishing communities due to climate change in West Sumatra. A positivistic-deductive research approach. Indicators / parameters used by the index to measure vulnerability in 2 coastal areas, namely Bungus Beach and Pariaman Beach. Secondary data obtained from the Geophysical Meteorology Agency station. Primary data through interviews with questionnaire tools on 60 respondents. The vulnerability model (V) is a function of exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC), which are then expressed mathematically. The results showed a vulnerability index of 305 with a vulnerable classification. Efforts to increase adaptive capacity and reduce women's vulnerability to climate change through a comfortable place to live, better access to climate change information and livelihood options. Gender-based climate change adaptation models for coastal areas are increasing women's political role, increasing women's skills capacity through field schools Climate and enhancement productive work. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Adaptation becomes even more imperative more climate vulnerable developing countries. Literature establishes that climate change impacts women differently due to socio-economic factors such as rights, cultural norms, etc. and other intersectional demographic characteristics such as age and location. The COVID-19 pandemic has also differentially impacted women and girls. In the context of climate change, this chapter reviews, analyses and documents gender disproportional impacts due to climate change and how it has exacerbated in times of COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter presents the state of art of gender considerations in international climate agenda, and India’s national policies, projects and local initiatives. Using the primary information from four states of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab who are implementing gender concerns in climate change, this work provides useful approaches and insights into climate change planning through real case examples. While highlighting the importance of three-step approach to gender differentiated risk assessment, gender analysis and gender strategy, it discusses of implementing such approaches into capacity development for implementation of climate adaptation activities and in revision of current states’ action plans on climate change, which gains greater focus for any long term recovery that takes sustainability concerns into account. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Climate change is increasing women’s socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting on their families’ food security, water supply and consumption and traditional livelihoods. Hence, women have had to develop a wide range of coping strategies in order to deal with these changes. This paper explores women’s narratives from both personal and community level experiences, providing a deeper insight into how and why women build resiliency at a household level, and how this resilience transfers to the community level. The study was conducted in four selected districts of Bangladesh focusing on four types of climate-induced disasters as a part of the first author’s PhD research. Data and information were collected through FGDs, KIIs and IDDs with women and participant observation in their homes and communities. A systematic coding and thematic analysis were adopted during data analysis. This paper particularly focused on five women’s personal narratives and the findings indicate that women are not simply “victims” of climate change, rather their lived experiences and daily life-practices make critical contributions to their households and communities when adapting to these changes. Women’s roles as individuals or collectively reveal their necessary and valuable contribution. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The existential environmental crisis prompted the United Nations to formulate the Millennium Development Goals at the turn of the 21st century in order to embark on an era of sustainable development. The progress and deficiencies in achieving the Millennium Development Goals provided impetus to the intelligentsia and policymakers to map out the pertinent goals for a sustainable growth trajectory for humanity and the planet. The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted in September 2015, took the shape of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. In effect, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals focus on protecting the earth's life support systems for intra- and inter-generational equity and for development that is rooted in sustainability science. Attaining these goals is an uphill task; nevertheless, scientific knowledge, trans and interdisciplinary inquiries, concerted global action and capacity building would provide an enabling environment for achieving the SDGs. This book explores the synergies and trade-offs between climate change management and other SDGs. It highlights the policy imperatives as well as the interrelations between combating climate change and its impacts (SDG 13) and food and nutritional security (SDG 2), water security (SDG 6), soil security (SDG 15), energy security (SDG 7), poverty eradication (SDG 1), gender equality (SDG 5), resilient infrastructure (SDG 9), and sustainable and resilient cities (SDG 11).},

A gender-sensitive perspective has not been taken into account sufficiently in scientific studies on climate change and health. This study examined the health impact of extreme heat events from a gender-sensitive perspective and measured gender-specific individual behavioural adaptation and mitigation strategies. A cross-sectional population survey was done in Leipzig, Germany, from July to October 2014. The survey was used to determine the relationship between the influencing factors such as gender, adaptive and mitigation measures and the health burden resulting from extreme heat waves. Gender-specific differences were found for type of income, personal net income and individuals who are strongly affected by persistent heat. A significant gender difference was also found for headaches, cardiovascular diseases, different climate adaptation measures and types of mitigating behaviour. These findings confirm other study results and indicate the need for further studies on gender and diversity aspects which take into account sociodemographic, socioeconomic and climate ecological differences. Taking the public health approach, surveys for adaptation and mitigation measures are needed which explicitly consider gender and target groups’ aspects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {About 240 million people in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region and 1.65 billion people in the downstream depend on ecosystem services from the mountains. The region is experiencing “double exposure” due to its rapidly changing socioeconomic conditions and the disproportionate impacts of climate change resulting from amplified elevation-dependent warming. Therefore, understanding the extent of impacts and finding solutions to build resilience requires not only a comprehensive research but also a shift in policy to implement and scale resilience building solutions to cope with, adapt to, and catalyze a transformative change. In this context, Resilient Mountain Village approach was piloted in eight villages of mid-hills in Nepal. The results were assessed against six attributes of scalability, considering credibility, observability, relevance, relative advantage, easy transferability, and compatibility. The impacts of various context-specific, simple, and affordable solutions, such asjholmal (bio-fertilizer and biopesticide), rain- and wastewater collection tanks, weather and crop advisories, etc., were also assessed to understand the change and adoption. As a result of a systematic bottom-up engagement process, a very high degree of adoption by communities and out-scaling/upscaling by governments and other projects was observed beyond the pilot area. Based on the experiences, a Resilient Mountain Solutions framework was developed focusing on three dimensions of resilience – climate resilience, socioeconomic resilience, and future resilience. This framework offers an integrated modular approach for smallholder farmers by providing package of solutions that can be customized to the local context and build resilience of the socio-ecological systems through integration into government’s adaptation program. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

It was observed that the integrated irrigation system was an efficient and cost-effective method to improve crop productivity. Consequently, the drip irrigation system with water supply from hand-dug wells is recommended as a flexible system that can accommodate various farm sizes and is particularly suitable for adaption by smallholders. Nearly 40% of the farmers were women that contributed to the easy adoption of the technologies.

	abstract = {Opportunities to strengthen resilience can be limited, as the adverse impacts of climate change become more severe. In these cases, it is recognized that there are limits to adaptation and that communities are facing loss and damage as a result of climate change. The perspectives of communities most vulnerable to climate change impacts—in particular those of marginalized sub-sections of communities whose voices and perspectives may be inadequately represented—should be reflected in processes that assess loss and damage and that facilitate relief, support and compensation for those affected. Unfortunately, community dynamics can often hold back women and marginalized community members from participating in or benefiting from assessment processes, resulting in under-reporting of their losses. Participatory processes such as the collective development of maps and calendars can be effective tools for communities and marginalized sub-sections to gather, understand, analyze and act on information about the climate impacts that they are experiencing. These processes can form the basis for accurate assessment of the economic losses and damages suffered. Research initiatives must also avoid the risk of leaving community members with disturbing new questions about the challenges they face, without also leaving them the means to understand the issues and take action. Through the course of this research, a number of participatory tools were adapted to the context of climate-induced loss and damage, trialled, reviewed and improved. This has resulted in the identification of methodologies that can be used for the specific purpose of community-led assessment of climate-induced loss and damage. The methodologies have been published in a Handbook for Community-Led Assessment of Climate-Induced Loss and Damage by ActionAid International, the Asia Disaster Risk Reduction Network (ADRRN) and Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) with the support of the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN). The participatory tools in this 7-step guide can be used by communities to assess the losses and damages they have experienced and to understand the trends and future changes that climate change may bring. They can use the participatory analysis to initiate strategic planning to reduce vulnerability to future potential losses, and request support from authorities. © 2020, Asia-pacific Network for Global Change Research.

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the existence of gendered climate change adaptation practices of smallholder farmers in the Gamo Highlands of Ethiopia. We hypothesized that smallholders’ adaptation practices are gendered because of land fragmentation and gendered division of labour. To explore this, we considered sustainable land management practices as a tool for sustainable adaptation and assessed the effect of land management practices deployed and land fragmentation on intra-household time allocation. The results indicate that although land fragmentation increased hours worked by men and women significantly, fragmentation increased the working hours of men more than women. Application of a larger number of sustainable land management practices increases the mean working hours of women, but leaves unaffected the working hours of men, implying that adaptation practices are gender-biased. Therefore, this study can guide land management decisions by pointing out that fragmentation results in long working hours and adaptation practices may disproportionately affect women. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Gender integration across national policy processes is critical to ensure effective implementation of climate change adaptation interventions in agriculture. This is especially so for countries like Nepal, where climate vulnerability and women participation in agriculture is high, accompanied by gender gaps in access to information, technologies, markets, and labor burden. To do this, it becomes necessary to address the inter-related issues of gender, agriculture, and climate change instead of looking at them in isolation. This study, therefore, highlights policy gaps to suggest a set of recommendations for improving gender responsiveness at policy level in Nepal. It presents the gender gaps that women face in agriculture, based on data collected from five districts of the country. Subsequently, using the concept of gender-agriculture-climate change nexus, it analyses 20 government policies and related documents of Nepal based on a set of five indicators. The policy analysis elucidates the level of gender integration in agriculture and climate change policies in the country. Eleven of the 15 agriculture related documents acknowledge the need to focus on women farmers, with nine of them also defining provisions for women-related issues in agriculture. Two of the five climate change policies merely acknowledge gender issues related to climate change. However, only two of the 20 policy documents recognize the need to address gender, climate change, and agricultural issues in coherence. Accordingly, the paper proposes a framework highlighting key points to make policy process and implementation plans in the agriculture sector more gender responsive in Nepal, focusing on the development and promotion of gender responsive Climate-Smart Agriculture technologies and practices. It suggests measures to increase access of assets and services to women farmers, improve their capacity to participate in decision making across levels, and promote transformative changes at both local and policy level. © Copyright © 2019 Paudyal, Chanana, Khatri-Chhetri, Sherpa, Kadariya and Aggarwal.},

	abstract = {Women's limited access to resources and decision-making processes increases their vulnerability to impacts of climate change. Despite their own vulnerability, women are often responsible for caring for close relatives, extended families and friends during hazardous and traumatic events (whether its famine, floods, drought or forced displacements). Based on experience and knowledge it is believed that women are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than men, primarily as they constitute the majority of the world's poor and are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. The paper proposes a gender sensitive vulnerable assessment framework that is scaffolded by three key concepts: exposure, temporality and resource base. Because the study is grounded in the Capability Approach Framework it captures multi-dimensionality and intangible goods which are emotions such as fear, anger, shock or shame. It seeks to better understand the differentiated responses of men and women to climate variations and stress such as extreme heat, cold, droughts or floods in a specific site, Lambani, in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The main aim is to understand different responses of men and women to climate change in order to design and populate a vulnerability assessment (VA) framework. In order to do so the Capability Approach (CA) is applied as a theoretical frame with its lens on diversity and social justice. The CA thus provides an expanded notion of human well-being that taps into the emotional life of women and men in Lambani. © 2019 Institute for Human Geography.},

	abstract = {In many developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, women in rural areas contribute significantly to the labor force. They are actively engaged in agricultural activities and thus are exposed to climate change impacts. Despite the abundent litterature on climate change, little is known about the participation of rural women in the adaptation decision-making process. Drawing on this research gap, the major attempt of this paper is to analyze women participation in climate change adaptation decisionmaking at the household-level. The study was conducted in the municipal areas of Bembéréké and Banikoara in North Benin. Primary data were collected by using a survey method on 120 households randomly selected. In each household, the husband and his wife were interviewed separately. By using a composite index of participation, the results showed that the level of women participation was quite low when it comes to identify problems, formulate alternatives and plan activities, allocate resources and participate in the evaluation of activities and outcomes for feedback purposes. However, women were more involved in the implementation of farming activities and, as well, took advantages of the economic, social, political or other benefits emanating from these activities. Furthermore, the analysis of the socio-economic drivers of women participation highlighted that women and men access to education, women experience in agriculture, women contact with extension services and women land ownership are positively correlated with her participation in household climate change decision-making process. This suggests that research institutes and policy makers could carry out actions or programs aiming at enhancing women access to education, extension services, and production resources. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Social capital is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of adaptive capacity to climate change. Beyond formal adaptation infrastructure like insurance and public disaster support programmes, it can be difficult to identify the role that informal social capital—such as relationships, trust, and mutual support between community members—plays in climate adaptation. Drawing on a multi-site qualitative study in the Canadian Prairie region, this paper examines how three forms of social capital (bonding, bridging, and linking) shape rural communities’ adaptation to climate extremes. Based on in-depth interviews with 163 community members, the findings demonstrate how social capital contributes to adaptive capacity, particularly in rural areas where more formal supports may be absent or lacking. We examine how social capital is affected by existing socio-economic sensitivities, such as rural depopulation, which can reduce informal social capital while simultaneously increasing people’s dependence on it. The findings indicate the strengths and limitations of bonding and bridging social capital, particularly in the face of future climate extremes that may exceed local adaptive capacity. Further, we find that informal social capital may also reinforce gender inequality, exclusion, and inter-group differences, indicating its limitations for socially inclusive adaptation. Addressing these structural factors can help communities move past coping and toward long-term adaptation. In the face of increasing climate risks, our findings suggest the importance of public supports that are attentive to local strengths, gaps, and social relations. © 2020, The Author(s).},

While the focus of the tool remains on women and men, it operates with an intersectional and non-binary gender+ concept and understanding of sex and gender relations. The main novelties of the tool are its evidence-based educational elements and that it encompasses seven gender dimensions addressing the main areas of life that play critical roles in producing and reproducing gender disparities. This allows for the identification of how climate policies interact with gender relations and can make substantial contributions to gender equality, as well as of areas in which addressing gender issues could render climate policies more effective.

	abstract = {Local governments’ limited mandate and capacity to adequately deal with increasing climate risk and impacts means that citizen engagement is becoming increasingly important for adapting to hazards such as floods and storms. Stronger collaborative approaches are urgently needed. At the same time, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on what inspires adaptation engagement in different citizen groups. Against this background, this paper examines the external/material (e.g., resources, hazards, public support) and internal aspects (e.g., values and worldviews) that shape people's engagement in and for adaptation. Based on a survey of Swedish citizens at risk from severe climate events, we show that engagement is a gendered process, which is mediated by personal values, worldviews and place—aspects rarely considered in public adaptation. While a high level of diverse citizen action is often related to past experiences of hazards, motivation to adapt goes beyond the idea of acting out of rational self-interest. Economic considerations (e.g., low cost) are not the only motivation to adapt; the potential of an adaptation action to contribute to green, thriving surroundings and mitigate global climate change was found nearly as (and among female respondents, more) motivating. Women were also found to be more motivated to engage in adaptation if this supports other community members at risk. At the same time, past adaptation action could not be linked to motivation to adapt, and was found to be negatively correlated with communitarian and ecological values or worldviews. This confirms that motivation to adapt does not automatically translate into action, and indicates a ‘mitigation–adaptation gap’ in people's climate awareness, which can lead to ineffective climate responses. Given these findings, we discuss alternative approaches to support increased citizen engagement and more effective and transformative climate action. We end with a call for public adaptation and risk communication that takes greater account of inner/subjective dimensions. © 2018 The Authors},

Without adaptation to climate change in agriculture sector, it will not be possible to achieve sustainable development especially in food security, and many people will lose their source of living. Putting adaptation and resilience into account before and during planning and national action plans will make great difference. Egyptian rural communities face other kind of pressures in addition to climate change that reduce their adaptability and affect the agriculture sector and its workers, which must be taken into account when considering the impact of climate change on agriculture, such as the lack of governmental information, government coordination with farmers, and guidance on adaptation to climate change, among others. Climate change impacts are not experienced in the same way by both genders. Women are suffering in many ways to reach to information and deal with the changing climate either that relate to agriculture or the extreme events. According to literature there is a gender gap in agriculture; addressing this gap before planning and making decisions could lead to better outcomes and butter futures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Adequate and proper adaptation strategies to climate change depend largely on activities in the rural sector, which drives national economy through exploitation of natural resources. Consequently, actions in rural areas are essential to successful climate change adaptation. Rural communities are highly dependent upon natural resources that are affected by climate change, thus affecting their food security, livelihoods, health, and physical infrastructure. Women and their livelihood practices are thereby affected negatively, leading to increased poverty level and low income, because they find it difficult to respond adequately to climate change effects. This study examines the past and existing interventions on climate change adaptation strategies in two rural communities in Oyo State, introduces climatepreneurship strategy, and assesses its effectiveness. This is an explorative study, employing qualitative approach to gather information through in-depth interview (IDIs) from 50 farmers, before and after the interventions. Data collected were analyzed using Atlas ti. This is a powerful workbench for qualitative data analysis using coding and annotating activities to generate different thematic issues for discussions and interpretations with networks. Study revealed that communities had previously experienced some interventions. Such had no impact on livelihood practices because steps to successful intervention were not followed. Socio-cultural practices hinder women development. The newly introduced climatepreneurship strategy improved livelihood practices. Study outcomes will expectedly be integrated into policy framework for sustainable rural women entrepreneurship development and also replicated in other rural areas in Nigeria. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the ways in which climate change-related interventions such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) may open up—or close down—spaces for transformation. We explore the interface between worldviews, power relations and policy interventions, focusing in particular on the way that asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations may be reinforced or contested through climate-smart agricultural interventions. It has been argued that fundamental changes required in the face of climate change can only take place through transformation across the personal, practical and political spheres. In particular, it is in the interaction between these spheres where spaces for transformation lie; for example, in the contesting of subjectivities casting farmers as passive recipients of expert advice, in the assumptions regarding what constitutes “good development”, and in how worldviews frame the way we see human-nature relations. Nevertheless, interventions like CSA are often focused mainly on changes to practices or technologies, rather than on how power relations or worldviews shape practices, food security and inequity. Through a case study of Hoima, Uganda, we examine the ways in which the implementation of climate-smart agriculture reinforces existing subjectivities and authority relations or opens up for new (and potentially more emancipatory) subjectivities. First, we describe food security and social inequality drawing on survey data from Hoima. Next, we examine how social actors such as farmers, project workers, local leaders, and government officials position particular farmers or practices as good/progressive or problematic/traditional. We then analyze how these subjectivities reflect authority relations, and the ways in which CSA reinforces or creates space for contesting these. We argue that a focus on commercial agriculture as “good” by many social actors also persists within CSA activities, and is intertwined with asymmetric gender and expert-farmer relations. Commercialization takes place within the need to increase agricultural production to feed growing urban populations. However, commercialization for the case of Uganda has also entailed state attempts to govern farmers through farmer associations, the institutional set-up through which CSA often works. A closer attention to these dynamics could potentially help create deeper transformational change through climate-smart agriculture and related climate change interventions. © Copyright © 2019 Eriksen, Cramer, Vetrhus and Thornton.},

	abstract = {Agriculture, the main livelihood activity for several communities in Uganda, is threatened by short- and long-term changes in temperatures and precipitation. The increasing involvement of women in agriculture has attracted a myriad of gender-climate studies. However, much of the focus has concentrated on the usual gender dichotomy that assumes homogeneity within gender identities. This study is based on the premise that while an evaluation of male- and female-headed households is important, it only forms an initial stride in understanding climate change impacts’ and adaptation analyses. Using focus group discussions and household surveys, this study unveils the climate change adaptation dynamics created by the different positions that men and women hold across defined household typologies in the Mt. Elgon region. The results indicate that male divorced/separated/widowed households are more impacted by crop failure than female divorced/separated/widowed households. Across the households, adult male and female vulnerability was attributed mainly to a limited asset ownership portfolio. Due to ownership of more diverse assets, coupled households had more flexibility to engage in a number of adaptive/coping strategies compared to any other household type. Women in coupled households were also more likely to adapt to crop failure compared to women in other household types, given that they have some access to and use rights of their spouse’s assets. Given these dynamics, it is concluded that issues of gender and climate change are multifaceted and that meaningful design and implementation of adaptation strategies should not view “male,” “female,” and “household” as homogeneous categories but rather recognize their variation in adaptation process. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Climate change affects different demographic groups differently. Pastoral women, being among the poorest of the poor, are expected to be highly vulnerable to climate change. However, empirical evidence on gender-differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacity is limited. A triangulation of different techniques including focused group discussions, individual interviews, case studies and structured observations was used to see if there is a difference in factors that determine the level of vulnerability and adaptive capacity between Afar men and women. Gender inequality inherent in the Afar customary tradition (Adda) acts as a risk multiplying factor, resulting in women being more vulnerable than men to climate change-induced food insecurity and related risks. Moreover, men have better scores in different variables determining vulnerability and adaptive capacity, including wealth ownership, wealth inheritance, household-level decision power, opportunities for community-level participation, household burdens and health or body mass index (BMI). Despite their limited scores in many of these factors, Afar pastoral women make higher contributions to household-level adaptation to recurrent drought and weather variability. A gendered approach that recognizes the difference in potentials, limitations and vulnerabilities of pastoral women and men is required for successful implementation of adaptation measures. © 2018, The Author(s).},

However, the extent to which these interventions enable or constrain the achievement of specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains unclear. Using a systematic review, we evaluate the impacts of urban adaptation options on SDG 5 (gender equality), This review highlights that the urban adaptation literature tends to focus inordinately on women's differential (and additional) vulnerability to climate risks with limited evidence on the gendered outcomes of adaptation interventions. We find that although some adaptations such as urban agriculture interventions unequivocally increase agency for women, early warning systems and building risk awareness through public messaging showed mixed effects, with the outcomes depending on the implementation of the intervention and socio-cultural context. Further, the analysis indicates that adaptations such as urban agriculture can positively impact agency but, may show negative interactions with other indicators such as women's paid and unpaid work. We also identify key knowledge gaps and reflect on expanding the scope of SDG 5 to take a more intersectional and relational approach to gender equality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study primarily addressed the capacity building processes focussing on women’s uptake of climate information at the users’ level and value addition process of climate information into agro-advisories at the institutional level, to reduce the risk in agricultural production systems. The pathways for improving uptake and use of climate information to help decision-making by women farmers are: delivering information and agro-advisories relevant to their needs, having trained local level communicators, and group approach and support to act on the information.

To reflect the gender dimension, my research examines the existence of MEKC relationship between CO2 emissions per capita and female participation in 18 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies for the period 1990–2015 using panel data estimation. Arguing on the existence of MEKC for gender–climate relationship in the MENA region, the empirical results show that the contribution of women is crucial to reverse the vulnerability of the MENA region to climate change. Thus, gender equality can be an effective factor in adaptation and mitigation measures.

However, where planned adaptation originates outside a community, it has the potential to alter or eclipse autonomous forms of local adaptation. This paper identifies the range of autonomous adaptive practices undertaken by a Maasai pastoralist community and examines existing opportunities and constraints to adaptation. Field data were collected at three complementary levels: community, household and individual. Results indicate that many adaptive practices used in this community have been modified from past risk management strategies drawn directly from pastoralists’ experience in dry-land environments. However, not all pastoralists are able to engage in these adaptive practices. Gender and wealth inequality pose a challenge to scaling up as they influence access to land and water for irrigation as well as financial assets required to access adaptive practices that are available in the wider community. This research concludes that planned adaptation should take into consideration the full range of existing adaptive practices and inequality in access as this provides information on opportunities and barriers to scaling up. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {While adaptation has received a fair amount of attention in the climate change debate, barriers to adaptation are the focus of a more specific, recent discussion. In this discussion, such barriers are generally treated as having a uniform, negative impact on all actors. However, we argue that the precise nature and impact of such barriers on different actors has so far been largely overlooked. Our study of two drought-prone communities in rural Ethiopia sets out to examine how female- and male-headed households adapt to climate change, particularly focusing on how a variety of barriers influence the choice of adaptation measures to varying extents. To this purpose, we built a conceptual framework based on the Sustainable Livelihood Approach. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with male- and female-headed households, community leaders and local extension workers. Our findings suggest that gender-based differences in the choice of adaptation measures at the household level are driven by cultural, social, financial and institutional barriers. Barriers to adaptation—particularly when interacting—have a differentiated impact upon different actors. This outcome hints at the need for donors and policymakers to develop intervention strategies that are sensitive to this fact. © 2016, The Author(s).},

The resilience of a community is influenced by social learning that can happen as people meet together and share their diverse experiences and knowledge. Surveys of 232 people from 13 villages, in three regions of Cameroon, provided insight about the role that internal village institutions can play in fostering community resilience. Almost all villagers, both men and women, are members of at least one group and the membership of these groups is very diverse in terms of family relations, gender, occupation, age, and level of education. While the groups were not currently working together to respond to climate change, the diverse social networks that villagers have in these groups have already fostered exchange of knowledge. Their existence in villages provides opportunities for developing and sharing of knowledge that can be important for climate change adaptation in the future. Community resilience could be better fostered through a deliberate action-reflection process that includes both men and women, and builds on the social capital present in communities. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To answer this question, we develop an assessment framework capturing key attributes of engagement and use it to evaluate peer reviewed ARV articles with a focus on gender published since 2006 (n = 123). Results indicate an increase in ARV studies with a gender focus over this period, with the level of gender engagement also increasing. There are a relatively equal numbers of studies categorized as engaging gender at a high, medium, and low level, with studies from Sub-Saharan Africa consistently exhibiting high levels of gender engagement. Gender focused ARV has a strong focus on examining female experiences, with few studies explicitly focusing on men, and no work accounting for those identifying outside the gender binary. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We use an intersectionality framework to examine how the adaptive strategies of Tanzanian farmers are mediated through their gender and marital statuses. Drawing on focus group discussions and using logistic regression to analyze questionnaire data, we compare the relative adoption of the different adaptive strategies of single, married, divorced, and widowed men and women. Our study shows that, while a woman's marital status is a vital factor in determining her access to adaptive strategies, it is a less important factor in the case of men. We show that, compared with other women, widows and female divorcees are disadvantaged in the field of agricultural water management, and divorced women assume relatively more income-earning activities outside the farming sector. Finally, we find evidence of livelihood diversification at the household level through specialization by individual household members. Based on the empirical evidence, we develop a typology with which to synthesize the linkages between gender, marital status, and adaptive strategies; and we subsequently emphasize the importance of an intersectionality approach to gender and climate change policy and practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The impact of climate change is disproportionately higher on women, the poor, and socially disadvantaged groups. Yet, existing adaptation approaches and perspectives pay little attention to the special needs of these groups. Based on primary and secondary information collected from Nepal’s Koshi Basin, this paper looks at differences in levels of multidimensional poverty between different social groups and tries to assess how these differences shape their respective capacities to adapt to climate change. It examines some of the challenges and constraints these different groups face in the adaptation process and the strategies they use to cope and adapt. Analysis reveals that women and marginalized social groups, especially Dalits and Muslims, experience deeper levels of multidimensional poverty and that, in turn, constrains their ability to adapt to climate change. Rural women are relatively more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change than men due to the complex socioeconomic, institutional norms and gender roles/relations that determine their access to and control over the physical, economic, human, and social resources required for adaptation. The results suggest that an interdisciplinary approach to climate change adaptation is needed that recognizes and addresses the special needs, roles, and constraints of women and disadvantaged groups. The organizational and policy processes as well as the capacity of women and disadvantaged groups needs to be enhanced to achieve better results or positive impacts of adaptation planning and implementation. A broader governance framework is suggested that would enhance the capacity of women and disadvantaged groups to respond proactively to climate change while at the same time working to change unequal power relations, institutions, and processes that have made these groups more vulnerable. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

But adaptation is surrounded by problems. Finance is uncertain and fragmented, mainstreaming into development is complicated, and technical solutions often overshadow existing social relations and institutions. From a gender perspective, and as a critical research initiative to support the building of sustainability science as an umbrella field, this article raises three pertinent questions on adaptation in the global South: what is its purpose, how can development inform it, and what institutions in terms of rights and responsibilities are core to it? Focusing on sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture, three main points emerge. Regarding the purpose, adaptation should be a transformative pathway out of poverty, ill-health, and food insecurity. Regarding development, adaptation can learn from how development theory, policy, and practice have addressed women, gender, and environment in varied settings and debates. Regarding core institutions, adaptation must address gender regimes that regulate access to, use of, and control over resources, especially those defining land distribution, labour division, and strategic decision-making power. To conclude, I propose gender-informed research questions for further inquiry. © The Author(s) 2017.},

Data were collected using structured questionnaire and interview schedule and analysed using mean, frequency count, percentages and multinomial logit regression analysis. Findings showed that respondents were mainly women (67%), married (92%) and between the ages of 41 and 60 (52%) with a mean household size of six (6) persons. Mean number of years spent in school was 10 years. The majority (40%) earned monthly income of N20,000 and below. The average farming experience was 21 years with mixed cropping (71%) as the major cropping system while combination of livestock and crop production (48%) was the major farming activity done. Farm size was mainly one hectare and below (64%) which was accessed mainly through inheritance (76%) and farm labour sourced through hired labour (50%). Major crops cultivated was cassava followed by maize and yam. Major adaptation strategies used by the cocoyam farmers in the study area included increased use of organic manure (42%), frequent weeding (10%), application of indigenous knowledge (20%), use of information from extension agents (16%), use of fallowing (9%) and application of multiple cropping (3%). Choice of adaptation strategies used by cocoyam farmers was influenced by age, gender, location of farmer, monthly income and labour. Based on the result of the study, it was recommended that sex and location specific adaptation strategies that are within the financial status of the farmers should be emphasized.},

	abstract = {This paper examines climate change adaptation and gender issues through an application of a feminist intersectional approach. This approach permits the identification of diverse adaptation responses arising from the existence of multiple and fragmented dimensions of identity (including gender) that intersect with power relations to shape situation-specific interactions between farmers and ecosystems. Based on results from contrasting research cases in Bihar and Uttarakhand, India, this paper demonstrates, inter alia, that there are geographically determined gendered preferences and adoption strategies regarding adaptation options and that these are influenced by the socio-ecological context and institutional dynamics. Intersecting identities, such as caste, wealth, age and gender, influence decisions and reveal power dynamics and negotiation within the household and the community, as well as barriers to adaptation among groups. Overall, the findings suggest that a feminist intersectional approach does appear to be useful and worth further exploration in the context of climate change adaptation. In particular, future research could benefit from more emphasis on a nuanced analysis of the intra-gender differences that shape adaptive capacity to climate change. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South-North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012). © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims at understanding how smallholder farmers are adapting to drought and what shapes their vulnerabilities and ability to adapt. Considering that their capacity to adapt to climate change has been undermined not only by the natural vulnerabilities due to their geographic location but also by the social context, gender and institution that interact to influence and determine household and individual vulnerability and responses to drought. Design/methodology/approach – Both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected by use of structured questionnaires from 128 male-headed households and 122 female-headed households in eight villages in the Nguru Local Government Area, as well as from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Findings – Climate change is not a concept recognized by most farmers and does not have standard translation in the local language; farmers believe the term refers to change in weather. Drought and crop failure are causing despair and frustration, and farmers reported that they are struggling to adapt. The resources and support inputs required for responding to climate change and variability are socially differentiated by gender, women’s and men’s responses to drought impacts as well as their access to adaptation resources and support differ significantly. Women are in particular unable to access the favored adaptation strategies promoted by Yobe State Agricultural Development Programme as a government support institution assigned with the responsibility of helping farm households adapt to climate change in ways that will increase their adaptive capacity. Originality/value – These findings are essential for informing policy decisions by ensuring that the experiences of both women and men and the context in which they operate are embedded into policy design. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Several studies currently exist which suggest various reasons as to how people especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change perceive their risks, and how this influences their responses. In this paper, I take a feminist approach to questions of social-environmental risks and adaptation to argue that risk perception is tightly linked to knowledge production, and knowledge production is a power-laden process involving the constant negotiation of resources, responsibilities and knowledge. I base this argument on the results of fieldwork conducted from September 2009 to May 2010 with women residents of two ejidos in northern Guanajuato, Mexico. In drawing from feminist political ecology studies, I intend to show how gender, environmental knowledge, risk perception and thus, adaptation are constituted by and embedded in social relations of power. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development integrates economic development, social development, and environmental protection, with three overarching objectives and essential requirements: (1) poverty reduction, (2) changing unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, and (3) protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is capable of promoting all three objectives by providing stakeholders with a framework for integrating and coordinating the various aspects of water management in a sustainable and holistic manner. This chapter relates the concept of IWRM to development in the context of the international community's sustainable development paradigm. Though there would seem to be a universal acceptance of the cross-cutting importance of water in development, relative marginalization of water at different levels has taken place because of competing interests. In the ongoing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there is only one target dealing specifically with water (drinking water and sanitation) within one of the eight goals (goal 7-ensure environmental sustainability). There is now a call from the water community for the adoption of a dedicated and comprehensive sustainable development goal onwater in the post-MDG follow-up. Some current topics that need to be encompassed by IWRM are succinctly addressed with reference to the recent international developments, including water security, human rights to water, gender equity, implications of climate change, governance, and the water-energy nexus.The ability of making operational the nexus of water with energy, food, health, and ecosystems by thinking "out of the water box" has become critically important. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA) 2015.

Aiming at a more nuanced gender analysis, this study examines how husbands and wives within the same household perceive climate risks and use group-based approaches as coping strategies. The data stem from a unique intra-household survey involving 156 couples in rural Kenya. The findings indicate that options for adapting to climate change closely interplay with husbands’ and wives’ roles and responsibilities, social norms, risk perceptions and access to resources. A higher percentage of wives were found to adopt crop-related strategies, whereas husbands employ livestock- and agroforestry-related strategies. Besides, there are gender-specific climate information needs, trust in information and preferred channels of information dissemination. Further, it turned out that group-based approaches benefit husbands and wives differently. Policy interventions that rely on group-based approaches should reflect the gender reality on the ground in order to amplify men's and women's specific abilities to manage risks and improve well-being outcomes in the face of accelerating climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

They can thus be used for designing risk reduction and resilience-building measures, programmes, or projects that affect specific groups within a community or the landscape. Beyond that, VAs can provide a platform that promotes interaction among otherwise disconnected stakeholders, as well as the evidence and argumentation for community groups to engage in advocacy with local and municipal/district authorities.

Seventy per cent of the 1.3 billion people in the developing world living below the threshold of poverty are women. It is important that the consequences of climate change should not lead already marginalised sections of communities into further deprivation. But key development issues have been at best side-tracked, and at worst blatantly omitted, from policy debates on climate change. The threats posed by global warming have failed to impress on policy-makers the importance of placing women at the heart of their vision of sustainable development. This article argues that if climate change policy is about ensuring a sustainable future by combining development and environment issues, it must take into account the interests of all stakeholders. The Global Environment Facility and the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol can play a role in ensuring sustainable development, provided they are implemented in a way that does not disadvantage women and the poor.},

	abstract = {Research into the role of gender relations in climate adaptation is still underdeveloped. Social science climate adaptation research thus falls significantly short of the reflective power of various feminist research regarding the role of gender in adaptation to climate change. Many of the available studies on adaptation are gender blind or reproduce an essentialist discourse of female vulnerability and victimization. This article seeks to narrow the gap by broadening the perspectives for a relational analysis of gender, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. It therefore draws on classical sociologist approaches to gender relations on the intersectionality debate, such as perspectives of Feminist Political Ecology. On the one hand, there is an argument for the identification of structural political economic mechanisms of hierarchization that lead to differing climate adaptation options among women and men. This includes both international and national political and economic state and civil societal mechanisms of regulation, which shape the individual and collective scope of action through their gender-, race- and class-specific effects. On the other hand, we argue for a stronger analytical focus at the subject level in order to capture the identity of political dynamics that contribute to unequal options for climate adaptation among men and women. © 2016, © 2016 Institute of Local Government Studies, University of Birmingham.},

They play a very important role in household nutrition management and resource management in terms of labor, off-farm products, and small savings. In the absence of help from formal and informal R and D and technology institutions, their knowledge and resources’ exchange system has to be very robust to cope with the seasonal shortages arising due to climate fluctuations. The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert-community levels.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to report findings of a study of vulnerability that identified adaptation strategies of male and female farmers in two regions of Eritrea. The country is suffering from food shortage because of climate and non-climate stressors. As such, erratic rainfall, chronic droughts and extreme weather adversely affect crop production. This paper answers the question of how policy instruments and cultural practices, and their interaction, increase or reduce the vulnerabilities of male and female agricultural producers, including producer perceptions of how instruments and culture can be improved. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews and focus groups were conducted in the two study regions in Eritrea. Documents and transcripts of the interviews and focus groups were coded by theme and analyzed. Findings: Findings revealed that the main rainy season has reduced from four to two months, and the minor rainy season has often failed. As a result, exposure and sensitivity to climate change affects all farmers. These climate change impacts together with Eritrean government policy instruments, including the limited availability, affordability and accessibility of agricultural inputs such as land, fertilizer, seeds, and male labor exacerbate the vulnerability of agricultural producers. Tigrinya farm women are the least able to adapt to extreme weather because of an unequal distribution of resources resulting from cultural, patriarchal views of women which have prevented them from being regarded as equal primary farmers and further limit their access to the resources mentioned. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the prescribed military service of men in their community (which is not prescribed in the matrilineal Kunama community). Producers perceive that addressing this gender inequality and improving government instruments, most importantly getting rid of mandatory military service, will improve adaptation. Practical implications: Concrete recommendations made by the community are reported. Originality/value: This paper presents important findings from qualitative research conducted in Eritrea. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

One of the key identified effects of changing climate is the expected increase in flooding events. Flooding, brought about by heavy rainfall and frequent typhoons, is predicted to increase in a climate change prone country like the Philippines. As a country which often experiences climate-related disasters, men and women have developed adaptation strategies that make them resilient to extreme weather events. Using gender-sensitive qualitative methods, this study shows the gendered adaptation to flooding in rice farming communities in Nueva, Ecija Philippines. Based on the initial results of the study, men and women adapt to flooding according to their traditional roles.Moreover, due to changing weather patterns which greatly affect their livelihoods, men and women have assumed new roles. This alteration of gender roles has significant impacts on men and women farmers and on the welfare of their households. This study highlights the importance of understanding the gendered adaptation strategies and their consequences that can provide a basis for designing long term strategies for adaptations to climate variability. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

Many organizations working to increase resilience to climate change with local communities also recognize the importance of gender, yet the degree to which gender is actually integrated in climate change projects is unclear. This study examines the extent to which organizations involved in climate change and resilience work in sub-Saharan Africa are integrating research on gender and climate change and incorporating gender-sensitive approaches into their programmes using data collected through a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey and key informant interviews targeted at government agencies, local and international NGOs, and other practitioners. The results show that although organizations have access to research on climate change from various sources, more is needed to identify entry points for gender integration into climate change adaptation programmes across a range of local contexts. Lack of staff capacity on gender, lack of funding to support gender integration, and socio-cultural constraints were identified as key barriers to gender integration by many respondents, particularly from government agencies. Enabling organizations to pay greater attention to the gender dimensions of their programmes is possible through greater collaboration across different types of organizations in order to share knowledge and best practices and strengthen the integration of research into adaptation programmes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This book has presented and assessed various approaches to assessing climate change risks and adaptation in Africa. These assessments are approached from multiple lenses that include climate model-linked biophysical modeling, multilogit analysis, and social approaches (e.g., focus group discussions and interviews). The focus of the book was predominantly dryland agricultural systems in which resource-constrained smallholder farmers operate. The results from different cases highlighted in the book give a strong indication that climate change is already having significant impacts on agricultural systems in SSA, especially smallholder crop and pastoral farming systems. However, it is apparent that there are considerable differences in the impacts from one place to the other and across farming systems, states, crops, etc. As such, although it is clear that adaptation is imperative, the direction and scope of such actions should not only be guided by regional and national imperatives, but also take into account local specificities. For smallholder crop farmers and livestock keepers, climate change is experienced within the context of their livelihood, which is tied to their past, present, and future. They have historically had to deal with the vagaries of climate and have developed several strategies to cope with and adapt to climate change and variability. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This synthesis reflects on key findings from integrated quantitative and qualitative analyses at the nexus of gender, agricultural development, and climate change. Linked farm household-, intrahousehold-, community-, and institutional-level data highlight significant and nuanced gender differences in adaptive capacity of individuals and communities to respond to climate change. The gender gap is also substantial in exposure to climate change and its impacts, and uptake of new practices that lower vulnerability. Women in agriculture will remain largely neglected by information and service providers unless their differing needs, access to, and control over resources are considered at policy and project design stage. Yet clear guidelines for addressing the needs of both men and women in different environments and agricultural systems are still lacking. Participatory ‘action research’ approaches with a focus on co-learning, and using innovative cell phone or social media-based approaches offer exciting new opportunities. Agricultural development decision-makers and project designers need to ‘design with gender in mind’. Equipping them with tools and knowledge of innovative gender-transformative practices and intervention options and creating accountability for serving women and men will be key. © 2017 The Author(s).

Drawing on Sen’s entitlement theory, we argue that a shift in focus from national food production to intra-household food access enables a critical reflection on consumption smoothing strategies adopted at this level. In particular, we draw attention to the tendency for women and girls to eat less as an intra-household adaptation strategy. We present findings from our research in rural areas of Bangladesh and note that adaptation strategies adopted by households in response to food insecurity.

The dynamic strategies of San Ignacio women and men in home gardens and small orchards hold lessons for other regions particularly related to adaptation to climate change via agrobiodiversity, water resource management, and diversified agricultural livelihoods. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Girinka ‘one cow per poor family’ programme has been implemented in Rwanda since 2006 to contribute towards poverty reduction, reduction of child malnutrition as well as to promote climate resilience among poor rural families. Under the programme, every family whose local community confirms it meets national criteria of being poor receives one dairy cow. Impacts of the Girinka programme on female beneficiaries for increasing livelihood options and enabling food security in the drought-prone Bugesera District as well as its potential contribution to climate resilience were assessed. The specific focus was whether the Girinka programme assists female beneficiaries to better cope with climate change in Bugesera District. The key consideration is the extent to which interventions reduce women's vulnerability to climate change impacts. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were used in this study. One hundred and thirty three female beneficiaries were interviewed and four focus group discussions held. The key findings of the study show that the one cow per poor family resulted in expanded land use, improved household nutrition and food security. Changes in agricultural practices resulting from the use of green fertiliser contributed to climate change resilience, increased crop production and generated income for poor rural women. The study reveals that while the government energy policy prioritises biogas energy production and the use of cow dung for biogas energy generation to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere for climate resilience, few respondents in the study could afford to buy biodigesters. Direct benefits for women who are responsible for energy and the collection of wood for their households are not yet being reaped and depend on affordable biodigesters. The main problems reported by respondents were inadequate veterinary services for care of the cow, the frequent search for water sources during droughts and insufficient land to grow fodder. © 2014 V.

Surveys were carried out in smallholder areas at two 2050s climate analogue sites to assess smallholder climate-induced risks, farmers’ perceptions, and adaptation options, with a gender perspective. Pairs of sites selected had similar annual rainfall totals but differed in mean annual temperature by 2–4 °C. For drier areas Chiredzi was hypothesised to represent Matobo, and for wetter areas Kadoma was hypothesized to represent Mazowe/Goromonzi 2050s climates. Differences in crop management strategies and gender issues vary across sites. At the drier analogue pair, higher proportions of households grew small grains in Chiredzi compared to Matobo. Implications are for increased uptake of small grains, in 2050s climates for Matobo farmers. Gender issues include labour for production and processing of the small grains, against a background of male labour migration. For wetter climates, soil and water management strategies are important options for smallholders. Accesses to draft power, labour, agricultural assets, social and financial capital in differently managed households are important for increasing adoption of effective crop management strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This is because, the region is a major producer of cassava and both male and female are largely involved in the production processes. Among others, food crop production is mostly affected by vagaries in climatic factors. This study was conducted to analyse gender-based cassava farmers’ climate change awareness and adaptation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 360 cassava farmers (180 male and 180 female) across three (3) States of Akwa Ibom, Cross Rivers and Ondo out of the nine (9) states that make up the Niger Delta region. The study employed descriptive statistics and Multinomial logit regression model for data analysis. Specifically, the study examined gender-based socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers; gender- based climate change awareness of cassava farmers; gender-based cassava farmers’ constraints to climate change adaptation and examined the factors influencing gender-based cassava farmers’ choice of adaptation strategies in the study area. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

While the programs we examine in this study are relatively new, and thus their long-term effects are as yet unknowable, our preliminary findings indicate that through technology and innovation, practical skills enhancements, and connections with local non-governmental organizations (NGO)-centered CCA projects, women have the potential to increase their political involvement and social status within their communities. While these experiences should provide women with more skills to enhance their social status, multiple structural factors in the regions on which we focused may impede women's political participation. We find that work-around strategies introduced in CCA programs may enable women to achieve greater autonomy. Correspondingly, NGO programs and interventions should be more successful when the state officially acknowledges gender equality and women's rights.},

Women in Bangladesh are disproportionately affected by these impacts due to the nature of their livelihoods, their social obligations and confines, and their unique nutritional and health requirements, particularly during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Climate change policy in Bangladesh seeks to replicate adaptation policies under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This paper will briefly review the policy response to climate change in Bangladesh. As climate adaptation requires a multi-sectoral response, relevant policy concerned with climate, adaptation, poverty, gender and health will be studied. This assessment will determine whether gender issues related to adaptation are addressed in key policy pieces in Bangladesh. Key interventions related to climate change will also be assessed to determine whether gender is integrated in operational activity. Finally, the role of women in the development of adaptation policy will be assessed by outlining their participation in adaptation discourse. Findings indicate that gender-sensitive policies are quite limited. Policies may acknowledge the particular vulnerabilities of women, but operational planning to address these is absent. Whilst some operational responses superficially acknowledge vulnerability and may include women in planning processes, few address the unique impacts of climate change on women. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

Lack of political power, small economic resources, gender-bound patterns in the division of labour, entrenched cultural patterns and possibly biological differences in heat sensitivity combine to make women and girls particularly vulnerable to extreme weather and other climate-related events. Adaptation responses will likely reduce some of these vulnerabilities. However, just as climate change is likely to impact more severely on women than men, the costs and benefits of adaptation could be unevenly distributed between the sexes. Unless adaptation measures are carefully designed from a gender perspective, they may contribute to preserving prevailing gender inequalities and reinforce women's vulnerability to climate change. Institutions and decision-making processes need to be remodelled so as to guarantee that gender issues are adequately targeted within adaptation.

From the perspective of sustainability science and feminist literature; three main findings emerge. First, as regards social goal setting; adaptation and mitigation should; like development; support the escape out of poverty; ill-health; and food-insecurity. Second, as regards institutions; adaptation and mitigation should address how gender regulates access to; use of; and control over resources in terms of labor; land; and strategic decision-making power. Third, as regards gender equality; adaptation and mitigation should learn from how development in theory and practice has addressed gender; women; nature; and the environment. At its core; the analysis contributes twelve salient themes that can significantly inform adaptation and mitigation in research; policy and practice; thus, serving as inspiration for a critical debate on much needed synergetic trajectories. © 2018 by the authors.},

Drawing empirical data from two drought-prone districts in Northeastern Ethiopia (Kobo and Raya Azebo), this article deals with the differentiated effects of planned adaptation, exemplified by Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Two layers of differentiating effects are studied by looking at the differences between households that are and households that are not targeted by PSNP; and the more detailed differences are explored by zooming in on male and female-headed households, respectively, within the subset of households targeted by PSNP. We use semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with female and male household heads and key informant interviews with government officials. Our study indicates that the interplay has a differentiated effect following the participation of households in planned adaptation programs and gender lines. We show that the effect on building community assets can be positive at the community level and expands autonomous adaptation particularly for non-targeted households; however, targeted households in general and female-headed households in particular experience a negative effect of the interplay: planned adaptation constrains autonomous adaptation due to time and labor demands of public work, program restrictions and local gender norms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Vulnerability and resilience indicators are measured by a combination of the level of household incomes per capita and the degree of diversification of these incomes. Thus, households which simultaneously have incomes which are below the national poverty line and which are poorly diversified (Diversification Index below 0.5) are classified as highly vulnerable, whereas households which have highly diversified incomes above the poverty line are classified as highly resilient. The analysis shows that female headed households in all three countries tend to be less vulnerable and more resilient than male headed households, despite the fact that the former usually have lower education levels.

	abstract = {In the countries most affected by climate change, such as Nicaragua, adaptation technologies are promoted with the twofold aim of securing the livelihoods of rural women and men while reducing the climate-related risks they face. Although researchers and practitioners are usually aware that not every “technology” may be beneficial, they do not sufficiently take into account the injustices that these adaptation technologies could (re)produce. Inspired by the works of feminist scholars engaged in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article attempts to demonstrate the need to broaden the debate on gender-sensitive climate change adaptation technologies. I argue that, first and foremost, this debate must question the potentially oppressive effects of the climate change narratives that call for technological solutions. Second, I urge feminist researchers and practitioners to denounce the counter-productive effects of adaptation technologies that impede the transformation of the “traditional” gender roles. Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in rural Nicaragua, this article calls for rethinking the role of climate change adaptation technologies in offering possibilities for challenging gender inequalities. © 2016, © 2016 Asian Institute of Technology.},

Climate change affects a wide demographic of the population in Bangladesh, and among those affected, women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, as is evident from the history of climate-induced disasters in the country. Climate change increases women’s socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their family’s food security, water consumption, and livelihood. Hence, their roles and contributions are critical in responding through adaptation. Nonetheless, in Bangladesh, challenges remain to incorporate women as distinct actors and active agents in climate adaptation programs considering the gender power dynamics that exist. In this context, this study focuses on women’s contributions as individuals or as a group and reveals their significant influence in climate change adaptation practices. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Policymakers and natural resource managers are increasingly recognizing the importance of broader geographic and gender participation in assessing climate vulnerability and developing effective adaptation policies. When such participation is limited, climate mitigation and adaptation polices may miss key opportunities to support vulnerable communities, and thus inadvertently reinforce the vulnerability of marginalized groups. This paper reports rich qualitative data from women leaders in conservation, development and climate adaptation projects to support local communities across seven Pacific Island nations. The results indicate the following priorities to support climate adaptation policies in the Pacific: (1) increased recognition for the importance of traditional knowledge; (2) greater support for local women's groups, including strategic planning and training to access climate finance mechanisms; and (3) climate policies that consider alternative metrics for women's empowerment and inclusion, formalize women's land rights, and provide land for climate refugees. Existing evidence is discussed which supports the importance of these priorities in the Pacific. Their input identifies research gaps in climate adaptation and provides important guidance for governments, non-governmental organizations, and development agencies leading climate adaptation efforts. © 2018 The Authors},

We determine that male and female respondents are not significantly different in their knowledge and perceptions of climate change, but there is a gender difference in adopting climate change adaptation measures. Male-headed households are more likely to adopt new technology for water conservation and to increase investment in irrigation infrastructure. The research also indicates that the adaptation decisions of male and female heads are influenced by different sets of factors. The findings of this research help to elucidate the determinants of climate change adaptation decisions for male and female-headed households and the strategic interventions necessary for effective adaptation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Although climate change presents significant challenges for the livelihoods of peoples depending on rain-fed agricultural production, rising unemployment steadily provokes youths' renewed attention to agriculture. This chapter explores young men and women's engagement, primarily as producers, in on-farm activities and examines the factors influencing rural youths' coping and adaptive strategies in communities of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. Farmers perceive observable patterns of rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall as major hindrances to various stages of farming processes, which eventually affect crop quality and quantity. Gender roles shape young people's experiences because discrepancies in assets mean young men and women are differently equipped to adapt. Notwithstanding, the climatic threats to farming are yet to drive rural youths to abandon agriculture for the cities, as they employ adaptation options within their reach. It is essential that gender-sensitive policies are developed to boost these efforts while promoting rural diversification interventions, which contribute to building resilience. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The tendency to rely on analyses of the sex-disaggregated gender categories of ‘men’ and ‘women’ as sole or principal divisions explaining the abilities of different people within a group to adapt to climate change, illustrates this problem. This framing of gender persists in spite of established bodies of knowledge that show how roles and responsibilities that influence a person´s ability to deal with climate-induced and other stressors emerge at the intersection of diverse identity categories, including but not limited to gender, age, seniority, ethnicity, marital status, and livelihoods.

In this regard, this study aims to contribute to studies that make gender critical to understanding the way that climate change is experienced. Socially constructed gender differences have a bearing on the extent of exposure to climatic shocks, leading to various patterns of vulnerability to these shocks. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to collect data. Findings: The study finds that there is an inherent potential within the study area for equal opportunities for both men and women to address levels of vulnerability to climatic shocks and, by implication, potential to challenge patriarchal structures that tend to characterize these study areas. The contextualization of gender analysis remains elusive in the face of increasingly shifting gender roles that traditionally defined women as victims to everyday vulnerability and more recently in conjunction with climatic shocks. Originality/value: In this regard, this research contributes to emerging perspectives on the potential role of ‘woman as heroine’ and challenges the perception of ‘woman as victim’ in environmental management. Considerations for mainstreaming adaptation responses to climate change do not necessarily have to consider women as a special social group in isolation but, rather, implications for both men and women and caution that embeddedness remains key for gender considerations in any rural context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses household survey data from Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model. Findings: Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. In contrast, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies. Practical implications: Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses. Originality/value: A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular, faces significant risks from climatic changes. In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by natural disasters and climatic changes. This study provides insights into the perception of climatic changes by operators and spouses in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Perceived changes in the climate have a greater impact on women because they typically lack the necessary tools to adapt to climate change. The current findings could be useful in managing climatic risk in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta and be helpful to policymakers in designing risk management strategies in response to climatic changes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study intends to explore various adaptation strategies that coastal people adopt to cope with the increasing saline water intrusion. To serve this purpose, the study conducted a survey with 318 landless people, 195 women and 123 men, selected purposively from two southwest coastal villages of Bangladesh. A five-point ordinal level Likert scale has been used to analyse data. Change in land use pattern, use of modern technology in agriculture, diversification of crops and income sources, using savings and harvesting rainwater were some of the adaptation strategies common in the study areas. The study found that women’s ability to adapt is seriously compromised by their limited access to capital. So it is vital that the government take up specific programmes to enhance their adaptation capacity through increasing income generating activities and credit opportunities.

Data collection was carried out with the help of a semi-structured interview schedule, from 90 respondents randomly selected from the village. Respondents were from three different groups belonging to fish marketing, casual labourers and homemakers in fishing households. In Versova fisher families, most of the family members are engaged solely in fisheries related activities and they were able to have a feel of the impact of climate change through various sources like mass media. Loss of shelter and declining income from fisheries complemented by unseasonal heat, decrease in rainfall, decline in fish catch and increase in price of fish for last 5 years were the most important impacts of climate change as perceived by them. All respondents reported lack of alternative livelihood opportunities. The findings of the study could help to develop appropriate strategies and policies to mitigate the impact of climate change to make fisheries more viable and sustainable for both fishers and fishing communities. © 2016, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.

We base our analysis on a unique integrated qualitative and quantitative dataset composed of household surveys and village focus group studies carried out across a wide range of environments and agricultural systems. We identify human population growth, commercialization of the economy, and natural resource use policies, in addition to weather, as key drivers of change. We compare the agricultural and livelihood systems of male and female respondents, as well as their productive resources, organization and access to services. Women have less access than men to common property resources, as well as to cash to obtain goods or services. Women control less land than men, the land they control is often of poorer quality, and their tenure is insecure. Women engage in mutual insurance and risk-sharing networks, and benefit from non-agricultural services provided by social support institutions external to the village. Formally registered, public and private external organizations that foster agriculture and livestock production have tremendous anti-women biases, and tend to provide support primarily to men. Policies and strategies are needed to eliminate those prejudices so that men and women increase their resilience and manage well their changing environments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change is projected to have severe implications for smallholder agriculture in Africa, with increased temperatures, increased drought and flooding occurrence, and increased rainfall variability. Given these projections, there is a need to identify effective strategies to help rural communities adapt to climatic risks. Yet, relatively little research has examined the politics and social dynamics around knowledge and sources of information about climate-change adaptation with smallholder farming communities. This paper uses a political ecology approach to historically situate rural people's experiences with a changing climate. Using the concept of the co-production of knowledge, we examine how Malawian smallholder farmers learn, perceive, share and apply knowledge about a changing climate, and what sources they draw on for agroecological methods in this context. As well, we pay particular attention to agricultural knowledge flows within and between households. We ask two main questions: Whose knowledge counts in relation to climate-change adaptation? What are the political, social and environmental implications of these knowledge dynamics? We draw upon a long-term action research project on climate-change adaptation that involved focus groups, interviews, observations, surveys, and participatory agroecology experiments with 425 farmers. Our findings are consistent with other studies, which found that agricultural knowledge sources were shaped by gender and other social inequalities, with women more reliant on informal networks than men. Farmers initially ranked extension services as important sources of knowledge about farming and climate change. After farmers carried out participatory agroecological research, they ranked their own observation and informal farmer networks as more important sources of knowledge. Contradictory ideas about climate-change adaptation, linked to various positions of power, gaps of knowledge and social inequalities make it challenging for farmers to know how to act despite observing changes in rainfall. Participatory agroecological approaches influenced adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers in Malawi, but most still maintained the dominant narrative about climate-change causes, which focused on local deforestation by rural communities. Smallholder farmers in Malawi are responsible for <1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet our results show that the farmers often blame their own rural communities for changes in deforestation and rainfall patterns. Researchers need to consider differences knowledge and power between scientists and farmers and the contradictory narratives at work in communities to foster long-term change.

Gender is one of numerous important socio-cultural dimensions typically included in climate change vulnerability assessments but it is rarely incorporated in adaptation research and planning. An innovative methodological model for studying gender and climate variability for use in the context of climate change was developed. Gender-sensitive qualitative and quantitative methods and gender analysis techniques were used to capture the voices of both men and women and quantify the degrees to which men’s and women’s responses to climate variability differ. This research tests the hypothesis that due to gender roles men and women deal and cope with climate variability differently. The findings confirm that there is a strong gender dimension to the way in which climate variability is experienced and expressed by farmers in their coping strategies to ensure their livelihoods and food security. Women’s and men’s perceptions of and responses to impacts of changed climatic conditions differ in important ways as they pursue food security. Such findings are essential for informing policy decisions by ensuring that the experiences of both women and men are embedded into policy design. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change, New Delhi, 2008), and subsequently the states have been asked to formulate the state-specific action plans to integrate the national objectives and to implement specific climate change measures. Several questions arise on the impact of mission-mode adaptation policy interventions on enhancing the capacities of women to cope with climate vulnerabilities. Gender is acrosscutting issue, and it is well established that climate change affects women disproportionately more than men due to inequities in accessing resources and opportunities to enable them to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as due to the roles that they play and the responsibilities that they shoulder. Addressing gender concerns in the context of climate change requires engendering the government-led adaptation strategies, supported by requisite budgetary outlays. So far the gender budgeting framework has not looked into the aspect of climate change impacts on women. In order to fill the research gaps, the paper attempts to bring forth the analytical inter linkage between gender and climate change by analyzing critically the budgets of select states of India-Uttarakhand (UK), Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), and West Bengal (WB). The paper attempts to quantify the public expenditure on adaptation to climate change for the select states and the priority accorded to addressing gender concerns in the various sectors within the overall adaptation framework. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

Floods, landslides, drought and extreme temperatures associated with climate change are impacting the agricultural productivity of the region. Consequently, this area faces ongoing food insecurity, particularly affecting women and children of marginalized groups. Although the aid agencies are trying to mitigate agricultural issues associated with climate change by introducing climate smart technologies, such as Multi Water Use Systems (MUS), Multi Irrigation Technologies (MIT), Conservation Agriculture (CA) etc., the local population has been reluctant to adopt these. Moreover, the low productivity of land forces males to migrate in search of better livelihood options, leaving women to bear the extra burden of domestic and agricultural activities, resulting in adverse effects on their health and nutrition.

Achieving the SDGs will be furthered by the closer integration of the climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) agendas. Gender provides us a valuable portal for considering this integration. Acknowledging that gender relaters to both women and men and that men and women experience climate variability and disasters differently, in this paper the role of women in both CCA and DRR is explored, shifting the focus from women as vulnerable victims to women as critical agents for change with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation and reduction of disaster risks. Appropriately targeted interventions can also empower women and contribute to more just and inclusive sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Although climate change is expected to increase vulnerabilities, marginalization, and sufferings of many in the Global South, impacts will be unevenly felt across social strata. Intersectionalities of social difference, especially along gender and class lines, differentiate the ways in which impacts of climate change are experienced and responded to. Feminist political ecology and feminist geography insights can explain how different groups of people understand, respond to, and cope with variability and uncertainties in nuanced and critical ways, thereby elucidating the gendered implications of climate change. With a regional focus on South Asia, the article underscores the key issues that can be applied geographically elsewhere. Gendered implications of climate change in South Asia are particularly poignant as patriarchal norms, inequities, and inequalities often place women and men in differentiated positions in their abilities to respond to and cope with dramatic changes in socioecological relations but also foreground the complex ways in which social power relations operate in communal responses to adaptation strategies. This is particularly evident in water-related productive and reproductive tasks in agrarian societies that constitute the majority of South Asia. As climate change is expected to exacerbate both ecological degradation (e.g., water shortages) and water-related natural hazards (e.g., floods, cyclones), thereby transforming gender-water geographies, it becomes imperative to undertake careful multiscalar and critical analyses to better inform policymaking. This article elucidates the complex ways that climate change will affect gender and social relations, thereby highlighting the ways that existing policy narratives and adaptation programs might be better informed by geographical insights. To this end, the article encourages feminist and critical geographers to more forcefully and fruitfully engage with global debates on climate change. © 2014 by Association of American Geographers.},

Communities in the Global South that rely on an intact resource base and struggle with poverty, existing inequalities and historical injustices will especially be affected by predicted changes in temperature and precipitation. The objective of this article is to better understand under what conditions local communities can adapt to anticipated impacts of climate change. The empirical part of the paper answers the question as to what extent local women engaged in fish processing in the Chilwa Basin in Malawi have experienced climate change and how they are affected by it. The article assesses an adaptation project designed to make those women more resilient to a warmer and more variable climate. The research results show that marketing and improving fish processing as strategies to adapt to climate change have their limitations. The study concludes that livelihood diversification can be a more effective strategy for Malawian women to adapt to a more variable and unpredictable climate rather than exclusively relying on a resource base that is threatened by climate change. © Author(s) 2016.},

It uses a discourse analysis approach to comparatively present a review of the role gender plays in climate change adaptation. Currently, two discourse storylines dominate the exploration of gender and climate change. One tells a story about women being disproportionately impacted by climate change and constructs them as ongoing victims. The other storyline explores the role women play in building adaptation and simultaneously presents women as both being more resilient and having more agency in these contexts. Applying a gender lens to governance could include enhancing the role of existing communities of practice. This chapter attempts to provide a detailed review of and means by which to understand and present how climate change and climate change adaptation is drivenby gender and the implications of this for ongoing adaptive governance. This chapter adds to gender analyses by considering the role of communities of practice arguing that their deliberate utilization can enable gender to be productively rather than negatively utilized to build robust, socially just, and innovative adaptation regimes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

Indian agriculture is characterized largely by small holdings. According to the Agricultural Census (Ministry of Agriculture, 2010-11), nearly 85 percent of the farmers are smallholders (below 2 ha) operating 45 percent of the total cultivated area. Overall, women play an important role in agriculture in India and particularly on smallholder farms. Out of the total cultivable area of 182 million ha, only 140 million ha is under net cultivation, of which 62 million ha (34 percent) is under irrigation in India (FAO, 2010a). Productivity is 130 percent higher in irrigated agro-ecosystems compared to rain-fed systems (Government of India, 2011). Hence irrigation is considered as one of the potential strategies for agricultural intensification to meet the increasing food demands and cope with climate change and variability. Climate change will significantly influence the role of women in irrigated agriculture and hence it is important to put special emphasis on mainstreaming gender while developing new adaptation strategies in the agriculture sector. © 2016 Selection and editorial matter, Udaya Sekhar Nagothu; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {Adaptation of rural communities to climate change has garnered much attention recently. Within this body of knowledge, two omissions are notable: first, while adaptation and coping responses of agricultural communities to climate variability and extremes are discussed extensively in rural planning, pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are neglected, homogenized, or considered ancillary to sedentarized agriculture. The mechanisms used by these communities to confront socio-economic and institutional limitations to climate adaptation remain relatively unexamined. Second, not much is known about pastoral women's perceptions of climate adaptation and coping. This article examines the socially situated perspective of women in the Maldhari pastoral community in Gujarat, Western India. Findings reveal that climate adaptation pathways traditionally utilized by the Maldharis are constrained by the institutional, policy and social context in which the community is placed, with specific impacts on women. The lack of recourse to traditional adaptation pathways in the face of climate vulnerability triggers coping responses for survival, livelihoods and food security, which produce gendered burdens especially in terms of women's work. Local perspectives thus shed light on how constraints to climate adaptation impact women in marginalized pastoral communities. © 2018 International Institute of Social Studies},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the relative importance of climate change in the context of multiple stressors in semi-arid Ghana. It draws upon ethnographic research in two agrarian villages, and integrates theories from resilience, vulnerability and feminist political ecology. The findings empirically demonstrate that many farmers do not worry about climate change, even in situations where local perceptions and the climate data show a clear pattern of variability. Additionally, the paper provides evidence of a 'gendered double exposure,' whereby patriarchy and local culture shape how different social groups are impacted by climate change. Overall, the emerging findings suggest that an overemphasis on scenario-based climate change impacts may detract attention from equally important non-climatic factors that loom large in people's lives. The article's central argument is not meant to downplay the ongoing impacts of climate change in Africa. It rather suggests that climate change should be addressed as one problem among many socio-ecological challenges facing smallholder farmers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Article investigates perceived climate change trends and the types of ecosystem-based adaptation that were adopted by various gender groups in the Nigerian wooded savannah.The study sourced data via a household survey, key-informant interviews and three focus group discussions in 11 communities in the study area. The study shows that the livelihoods of both male and female groups in the study population are ecosystem based. Perceived changes in the local climate included delay in the onset of rain, reduction in the total annual rainfall and early cessation of the rainy season which affected the livelihoods of men and women differently. Common ecosystem-based adaptation options are based on the impacts and the need for livelihood support, charcoal production by men, while women engaged in gardening and seed harvesting. The study also showed that uncontrolled harvesting of forestry resources without replanting have negative implications for terrestrial ecosystems and the livelihoods of both the male and female population groups in the study area. The study found that sustainable ecosystems will be enriched by involving a full range of capacity development that is beneficial to both gender groups at local and national level. © 2014 G.

	abstract = {This paper conveys the findings of the first phase of a longitudinal study into climate change adaptation in Atlantic Canada. Men and women from 10 coastal communities in three provinces (Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island) were interviewed to better understand how both sexes perceived and reacted to extreme weather events. Their responses were recorded based on their experiences, personal and community levels of preparedness, as well as help received and effects on their lives. Most importantly, the findings denote that more men were personally prepared and more active in the community than women. More men recognized a deficiency in help at the community level, and were critical of government in particular, addressing a lack of financial interventions and support. Women were forthcoming with their emotions, admitting to feeling fear and worry, and their perceptions in terms of impacts and actions were closer to home. The results support what others have shown that in rural and coastal communities the traditional division of labor may influence and lead to a gender bias in terms of actions and gradual adaptation in communities. There is a need to better understand how these sometimes subtle differences may affect decisions that do not always consider women’s roles and experiences in the face of extreme events. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Rainfall variability and increased temperature over recent years have resulted in increased vulnerability in an already fragile Ethiopian environment. The pattern of rainfall is experiencing both long term change and short term fluctuations and this is seen as a significant threat to Ethiopia’s growth and transformation. Climate change is prompting re-evaluation of existing strategies and the development of flexible models that allow programs to respond to the real and changing needs of rural populations. In carrying out local stakeholder analysis, CARE applies participatory values, processes and methods, to enable communities to articulate and enhance their own knowledge and understanding, and to plan actions accordingly. The Climate Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis (CVCA) methodology helps communities and facilitating organizations to understand the implications of climate change for lives and livelihoods. By combining local knowledge with scientific data, the process builds people’s understanding about climate risks and sustainable adaptation strategies. It provides a framework for dialogue within communities, as well as between communities and other stakeholders. Recognizing that local actors must drive their own development, CVCA prioritizes local knowledge on climate risks and adaptation strategies in the data gathering and response planning process. The CVCA methodology in Ethiopia has been used and adapted to increase understanding among stakeholders, gather and analyze information to design climate change adaptation initiatives, and integrate climate change adaptation issues into livelihoods and natural resource management programs. This paper discusses CARE Ethiopia’s experience of promoting Climate Change Adaptation through building communities’ and partners’ capacity using a range of approaches and more specifically CVCA. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

Drawing insights from three agrarian societies in the semi-arid region of Ghana using qualitative research methods, the study reports how people currently deal with climate variability as insight on how they will deal with climate change in the future. The findings indicate wide gender inequality in decision making processes and land access resulting from patriarchal local customs and institutions that shape adaptation responses of different vulnerable social groups to climatic or non-climatic stressors. Different adaptation practices of groups indicate that both climatic and non-climatic stressors shape the kind of responses that groups adopt. From the current adaptation practices, efforts to improve adaptation to future climate change at local levels must give attention to the nexus of both climatic and non-climatic stressors, gender, differential vulnerabilities and other subjectivities that produce a particular adaptation practice in a given place. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

It highlights that, to explain the position and situation of women and men, gender must be understood as intersecting with other sites of oppression. The chapter explores how gender has been conceptualised within the wider development and environment discourses and how in turn this has influenced policy debates around DRR and CCA. It seeks to problematise the ‘engendering’ of the two discourses, seeing a commonality as being a move toward a ‘feminisation’ of responsibility in policy and practice which needs to be addressed in any DRR including CCA approach. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Ilan Kelman, Jessica Mercer and JC Gaillard; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Less widely acknowledged is the intersectionality of these factors; that specific combinations of factors shape their own social position and thus affect experiences of power, oppression and vulnerability. To address emerging issues like climate change, it is vital to find a way to understand and approach multiple, intersecting axes of identity that shape how impacts will be distributed and experienced. This article introduces intersectionality, a concept for understanding multiple, co-constituting axes of difference and identity, and kyriarchy, a theory of power that describes the power structures intersectionality produces, and offers researchers a fresh way of approaching the interactions of power in planning research and practice. © The Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {The financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in developing countries is one of the core issue at the heart of the political debate over the global climate protection policy architecture to be set in place by the Paris 2015 agreement, which will govern the global response to climate change from 2020 onwards and will have significant implications for sustainable development in developing countries. This agreement will also have implication for the nature, pace and extent of sustainable development in developing countries. Climate financing is a critical lever for the transformation to low carbon pathways and for undertaking mitigation actions to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions which have been identified by science as the key culprit behind global warming. At the same time, financing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries, if not carefully managed, can compete for the scarce overseas development assistance (ODA) funds as well as for domestically mobilized funds in developing countries that are important for achieving poverty eradication, social development and gender justice. Climate finance must be managed both at the global level and regional and national level to ensure and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as key actors both in climate protection and sustainable development efforts. Gender-responsive budgeting exercises and analyses will need to take on board the impacts of climate change as well as its financing for sustained gender justice. This chapter explores the key issues and challenges for gender sensitization of climate finance instruments and mechanisms and undertakes a tentative assessment of what linkages exist between climate finance, fiscal policy and gender-responsive budgeting? © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Climate change and natural disasters are often closely interrelated, such that they comprise an overlapping continuum. Consequently, they are frequently conflated, both analytically in terms of the conceptualisation of local populations as vulnerable, but also operationally in terms of associated policies and programmes designed to prevent and overcome their negative impacts. These range from disaster risk reduction, through disaster risk management, to climate change adaptation. The tragic outcomes for local populations of climate change-related disasters, as well as other types of natural disaster such as the Asian Tsunami, and the Central American Mitch and New Orleans Katrina hurricanes, have resulted in a tendency to focus on dramatic big disasters. In such events the profound gender-related vulnerability of elderly, women, and children has been well documented. This has included women drowning because of their inability to swim, a deficit in human capital; women unable to flee because of their domestic ‘reproductive’ responsibilities to care for children and the elderly, linked to household social capital; and the prevalence of gender-based violence associated with displacement, resulting in the erosion of their human and social capital. All of these affect the capabilities of women, and therefore make them more vulnerable and less resilient to these types of climate-related disaster. At the same time, the essential, invaluable role that women play in post-disaster reconstruction, based on their community social capital, also has been broadly recognised (see Bradshaw 2013; Liu 2007). © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Caroline O.N.

	abstract = {The role of rural women in eradicating poverty and ending hunger has been recognised by both scholars and practitioners. There is an acknowledgement that women serve a critical role in the agricultural labour force, subsistence farming, and rural development in sub-Saharan Africa, yet their central role in food security has been largely ignored, particularly in policy (Govender, 2012). Although much of the labour of rural women is not nationally defined as economically active employment these women still spend long hours in undervalued productive and reproductive work to ensure the well-being of their households. Linked to this role is the challenge of dealing with rapidly changing climatic conditions. Women assume primary responsibility in fetching water and wood for meal preparation, and in tilling the ground. They are among the most vulnerable groups to climate change as a result of their precarious environmental livelihoods. Using data from a workshop with rural women to discuss climate change and qualitative interviews with rural women in selected rural communities in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal we explore the meaning of climate change. We report on the way climate change is understood, its effects on rural livelihoods and some responses to climate change problems experienced by the women in the communities. The women in the rural communities highlight that there are also social problems that have arisen from water scarcity. As a result of the household division of labour, rural girls confront particular challenges as they need to search further from home for water and are exposed to the risk of gender violence. © 2014 T.

	abstract = {Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change in the Pacific due to prevailing gender inequalities. Meanwhile, the participation and leadership of women in climate change adaptation has been identified globally as critical for fostering resilience in families, communities and nations. Aided by case studies from across the Pacific, this paper examines the differentiated impacts of climate change on gender and the actual and potential role of women in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. It evaluates regional capacity for gender responsive climate change action in the areas of policy, institutional arrangements, implementation and practice, knowledge and participation, to inform future decisions by development agencies, governments and donors. Research findings show that while the importance of gender equality in relation to climate change is recognised in theory, the value of active participation of women and women’s groups’ is largely overlooked in practice in the Pacific, at local and national levels. Recommendations are made for more meaningful incorporation of gender equality into climate change policy, planning and processes. The paper identifies a number of examples where a gender responsive approach aids effective climate change adaptation, and identifies measures through which gender equality and women’s empowerment can be strengthened to substantially build resilience to climate change. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate variability and change impinge upon different lives and livelihoods within agrarian populations in complex ways. While academic, donor, and implementer efforts to understand and act on this complexity have been profoundly influenced by gender analysis, most contemporary analyses are predicated on a construction of gender as binary (men versus women). This approach runs contrary to current understandings of gender and identity in the wider social science literature, which treats gender as a social categorization that takes meaning from its intersection with other identities, roles, and responsibilities. An emerging adaptation literature takes on this intersectional approach to gender, making conceptual, methodological, and empirical arguments against assessing the vulnerability of agrarian populations to the impacts of climate variability and change through binary gender categories. This literature argues that binary approaches are likely to overlook the specific challenges facing significant portions of any agrarian population, and therefore can result in maladaptive interventions that enhance, instead of ameliorate, the vulnerability of the most marginal and vulnerable. Though this emerging literature makes a compelling case for change, efforts to convince the academic and implementation communities focused on agrarian adaptation to adopt intersectional gender analyses point to two broad research frontiers. First, convincing these communities of the value of this shift will require an expanded, rigorous empirical base of evidence for who is overlooked by binary gender analysis relative to intersectional analysis in particular places. Second, facilitating the implementation of intersectional approaches will require methodological innovations that have thus far been under-addressed in this literature. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change impacts in the Arctic will be differentiated by gender, yet few empirical studies have investigated how. We use a case study from the Inuit community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, to identify and characterize vulnerability and adaptive capacity of Inuit women to changing climatic conditions. Interviews were conducted with 42 Inuit women and were complimented with focus group discussions and participant observation to examine how women have experienced and responded to changes in climate already observed. Three key traditional activities were identified as being exposed and sensitive to changing conditions: berry picking, sewing, and the amount of time spent on the land. Several coping mechanisms were described to help women manage these exposure sensitivities, such as altering the timing and location of berry picking, and importing seal skins for sewing. The adaptive capacity to employ these mechanisms differed among participants; however, mental health, physical health, traditional/western education, access to country food and store bought foods, access to financial resources, social networks, and connection to Inuit identity emerged as key components of Inuit women’s adaptive capacity. The study finds that gender roles result in different pathways through which changing climatic conditions affect people locally, although the broad determinants of vulnerability and adaptive capacity for women are consistent with those identified for men in the scholarship more broadly. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The growing risk of vulnerability to climate change is widely discussed in the scientific and political sphere. More evidence from local case studies emerges that document this risk. Vulnerability to climate change and variability appears most likely to negatively affect poor people, particularly women. Tendencies to widen existing inequalities have been observed. In the Lake Faguibine area in Northern Mali the social, political and ecological conditions have drastically changed in the last three decades. We conducted 6 single gender participatory workshops using PRA in two communities. The workshops assessed vulnerability and adaptive strategies to climate variability and change for livestock and forest based livelihoods. Our results show divergences in the adaptive strategies of men and women. Migration represented one of the most important strategies for men. Women perceived this strategy more as a cause of vulnerability than an adaptive strategy. Traditionally male activities have been added to the workload of women (e.g. small ruminant herding). The historical axes show that development projects targeting women have not integrated climate change and variability into their planning. Most activities have been built around small scale agriculture. With the drying out of Lake Faguibine, those water dependent activities are no longer relevant. Women have developed their own adaptive strategies based on newly emerged forest resources in the former lake area (e.g. charcoal production). However, women are hindered from realizing the potential of these new activities. This is due to loss of person power in the household, unclear access to natural resources, lack of knowledge and financial resources. Lack of power to influence decision at the household and community levels as well as limited market opportunities for women are additional factors. Even though women's vulnerability is increasing in the short term, over the long term the emerging changes in women's roles could lead to positive impacts. These impacts could be both societal (division of labor and power, new social spaces), and economic (market access, livestock wealth). Locally specific gender sensitive analysis of vulnerability is needed to understand dynamics and interaction of divergent adaptive strategies. Societal and political change at broader scales is needed to realize potential benefits for women in the long term.},

Although a number of studies have been conducted on gender and CC, information on gender inequality and CC adaptation strategies, particularly in Tanzania, is still limited. This chapter aims to first, identify CC adaptation strategies in the study area; second, examine gender inequality in terms of division of labor, resource ownership, and decision-making; and third, determine how gender inequality affects CC adaptation strategies. The chapter is based on a study conducted in Kilosa District in Tanzania, which adopted a cross-sectional research design. Primary data were collected from 50 respondents using a structured questionnaire and a checklist of questions for focus group discussions. Desk review of various documents was employed in collecting secondary data. It was found that various adaptation strategies were used by the pastoralists to adapt to CC impacts. It was also found that gender inequality in the study area made it difficult to implement various CC adaptation measures. It is recommended that gender-sensitive policies and strategies on household division of labor, resource ownership, and decision-making are required to enhance women's CC adaptive capacity. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The study sought to investigate how rural women are affected by climate change in relation to their livelihoods. It also explores women’s perception of climate change and the effects of those perceptions on adapting to climate change. Emphasis is made on the effects of climate change on crop production, livestock production and water sources focusing on Tsholotsho District in Zimbabwe. The study used a qualitative approach to obtain data on the effects of climate change. One of the major findings of the study was that the impact of climate change undermines women’s livelihoods which are rain-fed thus leading to accelerated food insecurity problems and heightened impoverishment.

	abstract = {Climate change and related adaptation strategies have gender-differentiated impacts. This paper reviews how gender is framed in 41 papers on climate change adaptation through an intersectionality lens. The main findings show that while intersectional analysis has demonstrated many advantages for a comprehensive study of gender, it has not yet entered the field of climate change and gender. In climate change studies, gender is mostly handled in a men-versus-women dichotomy and little or no attention has been paid to power and social and political relations. These gaps which are echoed in other domains of development and gender research depict a ‘feminization of vulnerability’ and reinforce a ‘victimization’ discourse within climate change studies. We argue that a critical intersectional assessment would contribute to unveil agency and emancipatory pathways in the adaptation process by providing a better understanding of how the differential impacts of climate change shape, and are shaped by, the complex power dynamics of existing social and political relations. © 2016, The Author(s).},
